It was Fran Lebowitz, New York City’s resident malcontent, who said, “If you’re a New Yorker, and you run into another New Yorker in Times Square, it’s like running into someone at a gay bar in the 1970s—you make up excuses about why you’re there.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor a moment, it appeared one of the square’s more contentious features—its glaring, oversized billboards—might soon be a thing of the past. A 2012 federal transportation bill placed “arterial routes” like Times Square (which feeds the West Side Highway, part of New York state route 9A) under the jurisdiction of the 1964 Highway Beautification Act. That law, a pet project of former first lady Ladybird Johnson, dictates that billboards may not exceed 1,200 square feet in size, nor stand within 660 feet of the roadside.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“All these billboards, they no longer meet the Highway Beautification Act requirements,” New York\\u0026#8217;s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, reportedly said during a panel on city infrastructure on April 30. “So now we\\u0026#8217;re going to have to go through kind of a complicated process with the state to yank them off because the feds are threatening to take away 10% of our money.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, localities that fail to comply are penalized by a 10% decrease in federal highway funding. But after Trottenberg\\u0026#8217;s comments appeared in \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/05/8567170/federal-act-pressures-city-remove-oversize-times-square-billboards\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea May 1 story\\u003C/a\\u003E in Capital New York, which may have been the trigger for the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/05/05/times-square-billboards-highway-beautification-act/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Elocal\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/06/how-the-federal-government-could-use-conditional-spending-to-force-the-removal-of-times-square-billboards/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Enational\\u003C/a\\u003E coverage that followed in the week since, the city\\u0026#8217;s Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) clarified that New York\\u0026#8217;s fundings—and billboards—were never at risk.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Funding will not be affected,” the NYCDOT confirmed to Quartz. \\u0026#8220;The signage will not be removed.” The agency says city officials are working with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWY), as well as their counterparts at the state level, to “identify a solution in which signage will remain unchanged.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe FHWA confirms this, noting in a May 7 press statement that the agency \\u0026#8220;has been working with the New York State DOT and the New York City DOT for nearly a year to correct this unintentional consequence of extending the National Highway System.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, some critics are tracing the unintended consequence straight back to Trottenberg. At the time Congress placed Times Square under the Highway Beautification Act\\u0026#8217;s jurisdiction, Trottenberg was serving as under secretary for policy at the US Department of Transportation. “It was her job to understand the legislation and serve as chief adviser to the secretary of transportation on implementation,” Marc Scribner, a fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://cei.org/blog/why-federal-government-threatening-times-squares-billboards\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eexplains\\u003C/a\\u003E in a blog post on the free-market advocacy group\\u0026#8217;s website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn any event, tourists and a few odd-duck, like-minded New Yorkers can relax: it appears the signs of Times Square are safe.

The company could have less than $1 billion in cash on its balance sheet by mid-year, he says, on the eve of what is shaping up to be an incredibly important new vehicle launch.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe solution of course, if it came to that, would be for Tesla to raise fresh capital, something it has done every year since its IPO in 2010. The company could issue new shares, borrow money, or do some combination of both. (For example, less than a year ago Tesla raised $2 billion in debt that could eventually convert into equity).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENone of those options is particularly helpful for the share price, though.

Elon Musk\\u0026#8217;s pursuit of these goals is laudable and it is precisely for this reason that he is hailed as the greatest entrepreneur since Steve Jobs.  There\\u0026#8217;s something missing in the logic of criticizing most companies for \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/380342/the-global-economys-bizarre-problem-too-much-money/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehoarding their cash\\u003C/a\\u003E, and then turning around to criticize Tesla for investing its cash.

Other manufacturers including BMW, Rolls Royce and Porsche have presented electric-powered prototypes.

In 2011, following the Fukushima disaster in Japan, Germany took the decision to shut down all its nuclear reactors. Up until then, a quarter of its power came from nuclear. That has since fallen to about 17% and is likely to keep falling, with both the people and the government opposed to the technology, according to the World Nuclear Association: “Public opinion in Germany remains broadly opposed to nuclear power with virtually no support for building new nuclear plants,” the organization says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the same time, Germany has hugely ambitious green goals. Five years ago it set a goal to produce 18% of its energy from renewables by 2020 (latest figures show it \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/359415/three-european-countries-have-already-hit-their-2020-renewable-energy-goals/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehaving reached\\u003C/a\\u003E 12.4%). The country also wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, and by 80% by 2050. The transformation is knows as the Energiewende—literally “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.dw.de/what-exactly-is-germanys-energiewende/a-16540762\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eenergy turn\\u003C/a\\u003E.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the short term, the closure of nuclear reactors hampered that goal.

(Of the five officials \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://dockets.justia.com/docket/circuit-courts/ca2/14-42\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Enamed in the suit\\u003C/a\\u003E when it was filed in January 2014, only Clapper remains in the same role.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe ACLU was prepared to argue that the government\\u0026#8217;s dragnet violated the US constitution\\u0026#8217;s prohibitions on unreasonable searches, but it didn\\u0026#8217;t have to. A three-judge panel agreed first that the Patriot Act, the 2001 law that supposedly gave the government these powers, does not allow for the collection of data without a warrant. Specifically, they cited section 215 of the act:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EIn keeping with this usage, §215 does not permit an investigative demand for any information relevant to fighting the war on terror, or anything relevant to whatever the government might want to know. It permits demands for documents “relevant to an authorized investigation.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe government has not attempted to identify to what particular “authorized investigation” the bulk metadata of virtually all Americans’ phone calls are relevant. Throughout its briefing, the government refers to the records collected under the telephone metadata program as relevant to “counterterrorism investigations,” without identifying any specific investigations to which such bulk collection is relevant.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8230; Put another way, the government effectively argues that there is only one enormous “anti-terrorism” investigation, and that any records that might ever be of use in developing any aspect of that investigation are relevant to the overall counterterrorism effort. The government’s approach essentially reads the “authorized investigation” language out of the statute.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe judges also cite Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower now living in exile in Russia, as the key source of the revelation of this illegal program. Snowden, of course, has not returned to the US for fear of prosecution—while the government officials who designed and executed the program don\\u0026#8217;t appear to face any such concern.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s not clear how the government will respond to this decision; it has the opportunity to appeal to the US Supreme Court. There also are other, pending cases against the law, as well as a bill in Congress that intends to repeal bulk data collection.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;This ruling focuses on the phone-records program, but it has far broader significance, because the same defective legal theory that underlies this program underlies many of the government’s other mass-surveillance programs,\\u0026#8221; Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU\\u0026#8217;s lead counsel, said in a statement. \\u0026#8220;The ruling warrants a reconsideration of all of those programs, and it underscores once again the need for truly systemic reform.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEither way, this ruling is a big win for civl liberties advocates—and an interesting example for other nations. Even as the US appears more likely than ever to dismantle some of the surveillance appartus it put in place following a shocking terror attack, France has \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32587377\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ejust enacted\\u003C/a\\u003E a sweeping intelligence measure in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=400165\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/400165/forget-unconstitutional-americas-mass-surveillance-program-is-just-plain-illegal/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T11:30:59-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=400165\",\"dc_creator\":\"Tim Fernholz\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/clapper.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"clapper\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/clapper.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/400165/forget-unconstitutional-americas-mass-surveillance-program-is-just-plain-illegal/"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:30:59 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Forget unconstitutional, America&#8217;s mass surveillance program is just plain illegal"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:01:29 UTC +00:00]]

In a continuous shot, we follow Tanaka, as he plods through the field, acting with mysterious motivations upon the objects in turn -- pouring shampoo into a blue plastic sieve, for instance, or sliding a stockpot off a wooden plank. Some of the actions are violent -- he smashes out the panes of a window with a wooden stool, breaks all the shelves in a cheap bookcase -- but undertaken with an ennui reserved for banal but frustrating workaday tasks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://media.mutualart.com/Images/2015_05/04/20/200238301/97e04ae8-5ba3-4b73-bbaf-3982ec47d98d_570.Jpeg\\\" style=\\\"width: 570px;\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EKoki Tanaka, \\u003Cem\\u003EEverything is Everything\\u003C/em\\u003E, 2006.

If \\u003Cem\\u003EEverything is Everything \\u003C/em\\u003Ewas categorized linguistically, its sentences would be passive: the object is subject to an action (verb). The objects themselves are unremarkable, cheap, disposable items; the actions creative or idle \\\"misuses\\\" of the objects in question. What we might otherwise call the subject -- the person or thing doing the flinging, the stretching, the stacking, the kicking -- is suppressed, unknown or unimportant, indicated only by the hands, and sometimes feet, that manipulate the objects. Each action is a short, jaunty sentence, with playful, quick edits. \\u003Cem\\u003EWalking Through\\u003C/em\\u003E, on the other hand, is one epic, run-on sentence: a 55-minute-long durational performance, where a single subject finds himself beleaguered by a sea of objects, and performs a seemingly unending series of hollow actions.

Tanaka's role becomes that of instigator and observer: he provides the parameters of the situation, but lets events unfold according to the actions and feelings of the participants. By multiplying the subjects, these experiments yield a \\\"microsociety\\\": leaders emerge, tempers are tested, but negotiation and compromise contribute to the consensus essential to perform the task. \\\"Let's give it a try,\\\" \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/66657885\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Esays one of the potters\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\\"We need your hands as well,\\\" another encourages, as ten hands at once anxiously start towards the beginnings of a clay pot.

One project asked participants to swing flashlights while walking in the dark, another prompted participants to drink a communal pot of tea assembled from various sources (post-2011 tea leaves carry the threat of radioactive contamination). As the artist explains, after disaster struck, \\\"the background to our casual behaviors\\\" took on a political dimension: the simple act of using the stairs, for instance, rather than an elevator or escalator becomes \\\"a stand against relying on electricity -- that is, nuclear power.\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://media.mutualart.com/Images/2015_05/04/20/200615954/83b11ac1-3d28-41a0-867c-308ea6570897_570.Jpeg\\\" style=\\\"width: 570px;\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\\"Koki Tanaka: A Vulnerable Narrator,\\\" Deutsche Bank \\\"Artist of the Year\\\" 2015 at Deutsche Bank KunstHalle, installation view. © Koki Tanaka / Deutsche Bank KunstHalle.

These organizations come from communities both large and small, all with the intent on bringing excitement and enjoyment to the public.  For many years these communities have created strong cultural identities with the intent to share these cherished places.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Arts are such important parts of our cultural identity that full inclusion should be woven into the fabric of their mission.  Truth be told one would be hard pressed to find any of these organizations against full inclusion the question is \\\"how do we get from A to B to inclusion.\\\"  The fear of doing it wrong has plagued many organizations decades before and after the passage of the ADA.  The modern landscape of access in theaters and museums is really held within each individual entity and their own \\\"personal\\\" commitment to creating access and inclusion.  The one thing I always think about when working in the arts is \\\"how can I get more bodies in the door.\\\" The organization itself is responsible for putting out a good product and the disability community is responsible for getting people in the door enjoying the experience.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere is good news, access to the Arts started many years ago and has continued with strong community leadership and the future looks promising from all angles of inclusion.  There is a woman from The Kennedy Center in Washington DC, Betty Siegel, who has been pivotal in the past and future of inclusion.  Her work and outreach paved the road for museums, theaters and cultural institutions to better understand proper policies and procedures for access and inclusion.  She also created the very important  \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.kennedy-center.org/accessibility/education/lead/conference.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ELEAD conference\\u003C/a\\u003E (Leadership and Exchange in Arts and Disability) which offers a yearly opportunity for all organizations to learn about inclusive practices. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAdvocates for access in the arts have been able to create the proper policies to govern without \\\"jailing\\\" the creative process.   Although some cultural leaders will look for legal loopholes, others will build bridges, but one way or another these places are part of our communities and should belong to the people, all of the people.  True inclusion should not be limited to the physical space but the entire experience must be accessible.  From Board members to staff, access needs to be spoken about and included openly and often.  The arts represent all of our senses and it puts them together in unique ways that should be experienced by everyone.  The future of access is as wide as any canvas and more colorful than any costume.  The possibilities seem endless and the technology is unstoppable.  The largest obstacles seem to be two things, lack of funding and space that is poorly designed.  Make no mistake these are huge obstacles when you are working with limited resources but hearts filled with desire for inclusion.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHere's what the future looks like.  Currently places such as \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/accessindy/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EIndianapolis\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.vsaaz.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EArizona\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/ChicagoCulturalAccessibilityConsortium\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EChicago\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://njtheatrealliance.org/cultural-access-network-project\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ENew Jersey\\u003C/a\\u003E , \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ca-ne.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EBoston\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.flaccess.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EFlorida\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pittsburghartscouncil.org/accessibility\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EPittsburgh\\u003C/a\\u003E and the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/bayareaaccess\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EBay Area\\u003C/a\\u003E have websites or Facebook pages dedicated to access in the Arts.  Having the ability to reach out to the community via social media is an advance in access to the arts.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSocial media has given cultural organizations the ability to reach out to the diverse disability community in a way that is cost effective and easy to maintain. On these websites you will learn that many museums and theaters provide services such as captioned videos, sign language interpreters, Braille or large print and assisted listening devices. One technology that all organizations need to consider is the inexpensive hearing loop systems.  These provide audio assistance for hundreds of thousands using hearing aids by enhancing the ability to hear when someone is using a microphone or PA system.  There are also innovative ways to use tactile displays for guest experience.  The museum at Pearl Harbor has amazing tactile displays of the model ships and artifacts from the infamous day in history.  Very soon it will also be viable to offer sign language interpretation via the smartphone so people who are deaf or hard of hearing will be able to use their own device at their own leisure for on-demand interpretation.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago offers audio described performances and touch tours of the set for people who are blind or have low vision.  Both offerings are easy to initiate and have been overly successful.  Children's Museums across the country have been offering special programs for families and children with disabilities such as Autism.  Finally, many communities have created working groups or consortium to brainstorm the possibilities for inclusion. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLynn Walsh Co-Chair, Chicago Cultural Accessibility Consortium (CCAC), says:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003EFrom what I'm seeing in Chicago, I think the future looks bright for access in the arts.  I am encouraged by the number of cultural organizations enthusiastically participating in workshops offered by CCAC.  Attendance for the LEAD conference (Leadership Exchange in Arts \\u0026 Disability), which was held in Chicago last year, was at an all-time high. But what cultural administrators need to understand is that the job is never done.  To be accessible and inclusive is an on-going commitment.  In the perfect access world, all cultural organizations would understand the importance of having a position dedicated to access and inclusion.

One day on the hunt for doco ideas I spotted a book that had 365 pages, each page with a number on it going upward from 1. I thought, \\\"why not a documentary over one whole year,\\\" and then I thought, \\\"why not 365 documentaries in 365 days.\\\" And this is where the madness began. The concept of speaking to strangers was inspired by the Humans Of New York photography blog. Together with Carl, we worked hard to capture the essence of humanity in our films, which connects each of the HONY portraits. I think we underestimated how much we would come to care for each of the stories that we were sharing, and also underestimated the power they would have to encourage a shift of mentality. So during this journey of celebrating humanity our mission very quickly became one of spreading the idea of compassion over fear, love over hate.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECarl:\\u003C/strong\\u003E It kind of developed from a few ideas into one. We were both working full time in the media industry and were looking for a project to work on together. We juggled with the idea of travelling and film making and even thought about creating a travel blog, but thought it had all been done before. After some inspiration from Brandon from t\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.humansofnewyork.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ehe Humans of New York blog\\u003C/a\\u003E, and realizing how much his stories were bringing people together, Epiphany had the crazy (at that moment we didn't realise just how crazy) idea of meeting a stranger everyday we were travelling and making a film about them, then to top it off we thought why not do this for a year. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EErin: How did you make the project happen financially and professionally?

We left Australia with 3 months of our trip funded through some corporate investment and along the way had to get very creative with how we funded the other 9 months (all the while still producing a film a day). Once we had built an audience who were regularly watching the films we were able to leverage this with organizations and tourism boards for some sponsorship, we also did a crowdfunding campaign through kickstarter, we used accumulated frequent flyer points, we also traded our filmmaking skills for food and accommodation along the way and finally we kept a strict diet of rice, kebabs, and free breakfasts at hostels.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nErin: What was the most surprising thing you learned from one of the strangers you talked to?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EEpiphany:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Every single stranger surprised me. I love making a first judgment or impression of someone and then watching that stranger kick that assumption to the curb once they share who they really are with us, it's fascinating. One of the many times this happened was in New Orleans in the USA. It was during the French Quarter Festival and we were on Bourbon St when we met a beautiful dragqueen. In her daily life, Marc was a father of 3, husband to his wife, a surgeon and a nationally ranked body builder. It wasn't only just these gob-smacking details about Marc that was what was so surprising, it was his mentality that really dropped our jaws. Marc believes, you should live how you want and need to live, be exactly who you are, never ashamed of that, because he is reminded too frequently how short life is and he doesn't want to spend even one second not living in truth. I think this was the first time that a Stranger told us about the need to be happy in your own skin, and this was a theme that popped up a lot in a number of docobites.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EErin: Did you see any consistent themes emerge amongst the strangers you conversed with?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EEpiphany: \\u003C/strong\\u003EEach of the 365 stories we shared crossover with each other in some way. This again just supports the idea of all of us being connected. Some of the major themes include a need to belong, to have purpose, to love and to be loved, to prioritize family, be respected, even the desire and almost basic need to be able to express yourself creatively. These themes come from human stories, stories that are voiced from a humanity that is resilient, and vulnerable, that believes in love and hopes for peace.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECarl:\\u003C/strong\\u003E I think the themes I mentioned above, love, family, friendship, a sense of purpose and happiness were all pretty consistent themes throughout the films. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nErin: How do you think this project changed your view of humanity?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EEpiphany: \\u003C/strong\\u003EIt made me realize that there is only one humanity, and we are all a part of it. Before we left, I would often feel different, isolated, as if both the person on the other side of the world and the person at the other end of the bus was someone I had nothing in common with. Doing 365 docobites has made me realize, we all have everything in common. And once I got my head around that, a lot of things fell into place and I now look at the world very differently. With unrelenting hope and compassion. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECarl:\\u003C/strong\\u003E It made we realise that we are all so similar in certain ways, and we are all looking for very similar things out of life. It didn't matter what country we were in, whether we were in New York City or in rural Botswana the people we spoke to were all yearning for the same things, love, family, friendship, a sense of purpose, happiness, it was really amazing to see people from all walks of life talking about how these are the most important things. I think this project has changed my view on humanity by proving (to myself at least) that you can not judge someone by their, nationality, religion, race, lifestyle or so many of the other thing we do judge people by, the only way to really know someone is to sit down and have a good chat with them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow would you summarize your Docobites experience in one sentence?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECarl:\\u003C/strong\\u003E A completely eye opening and enriching experience that has helped me to understand what is truly important in life and why we should all be looking out for each other a whole lot more.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EEpiphany:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you want to check out the Docobites, make sure to visit\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://365docobites.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E the official website,\\u003C/a\\u003E where you can view all 365 of these short films! \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T14:03:09-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erin-mckelle/post_9421_b_7226486.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erin-mckelle/post_9421_b_7226486.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 18:03:09 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A Talk With Epiphany Morgan and Carl Mason"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:01:37 UTC +00:00]]

I am a fan of family-friendly fare, but after Act I, I considered leaving (which I would never actually do). I did like the performers, who I believe overall were more effective during Act II. And I might have nominated Matthew Morrison, who I found charming in a somewhat tricky role. But that was a tough category. I also liked Rob McClure, who got left out. Buried in all of this \\\"Harvey\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-21-1429637700-1026528-tn500_tonypagespeedcexwvpb9r4kkf9n8lnnvk.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-04-21-1429637700-1026528-tn500_tonypagespeedcexwvpb9r4kkf9n8lnnvk.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-21-1429637700-1026528-tn500_tonypagespeedcexwvpb9r4kkf9n8lnnvk-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"252\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" style=\\\"float: right; margin:10px\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E snub\\\" drama is the fact that a lot of shows got the shaft, including \\u003Cem\\u003EHoneymoon in Vegas\\u003C/em\\u003E, which was a pretty acclaimed show with a score by a beloved theater composer and starring theater folks. As for \\u003Cem\\u003EFinding Neverland\\u003C/em\\u003E, while I liked the other performers, I just don't think I would have nominated them in their respective categories. Harvey Weinstein's participation is irrelevant to that analysis. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI do think the post-nomination coverage has been because of Harvey. The amount of coverage about the \\\"snub,\\\" all mentioning the show's producer, was remarkable. For example, Michael Riedel wrote that whole column last Friday about Tony voter tickets being yanked (even though they were reinstated). Absent in the telling was that it's not so rare to do such a thing. As Riedel pointed out, \\u003Cem\\u003EFish in the Dark\\u003C/em\\u003E is doing it this season also. But, aside from that, the process has a long history. Recent examples include \\u003Cem\\u003EI'll Eat You Last\\u003C/em\\u003E and the one-man \\u003Cem\\u003EMacbeth\\u003C/em\\u003E. Even producers of the 2012 revival of \\u003Cem\\u003EStreetcar Named Desire \\u003C/em\\u003Erescinded voter tickets -- and it was nominated for one award! The chance of winning a costume design Tony just wasn't worth the free tickets to them. The thing that makes \\u003Cem\\u003EFinding Neverland\\u003C/em\\u003E different is it is a big musical that wants to tour. Usually the shows involved are limited engagement, star vehicles that will be seen in maybe one or two cities outside of NY. As a political move, withdrawing these invites is dicey. By rescinding voter invitations, the people who are left out are often road presenters, who come in during May and see everything still available to see. Weinstein and co. wants those folks to see \\u003Cem\\u003EFinding Neverland\\u003C/em\\u003E, which likely is the cause of the reversal. But was it really necessary? \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Graduate \\u003C/em\\u003Erescinded voter invites, and it embarked on a large tour. It was nice that Harvey and company changed course. (For the record, the official explanation that Weinstein gave to Reidel was that he was never informed about the rescission and, as soon as he was, he asked the voters be re-invited.) Probably the right political move. But if another producer had done it would it have garnered a Riedel column? Maybe, but probably less fulsome of one. If the show was produced by Daryl Roth, would she have been mentioned in every single story about its failure to get nominations? Unlikely.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat surprised me most about the nominations?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI didn't think there were any real shockers in the categories. Maybe \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time \\u003C/em\\u003Efor choreography. Plays are eligible for the award, but I think the last one to get a nod was \\u003Cem\\u003EDancing at Lughnasa\\u003C/em\\u003E in 1992. I love \\u003Cem\\u003ECurious Incident\\u003C/em\\u003E, and the orchestrated movements are amazingly timed, but I'm not sure I would have nominated it here. I would have nominated Joshua Bergasse a second time, this time for his work in \\u003Cem\\u003EGigi\\u003C/em\\u003E. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI also would have predicted Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical incorrectly, and there were some others I would have missed along the way. But there was no person missing I thought: \\\"That person would have won if...\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was surprised the \\\"tie\\\" rule didn't have more of an impact. We were led to believe that the rule was enacted because of frequent ties. This year in the performance categories there only seems to have been one tie -- in Best Performance by An Actor in a Featured Role in a Play. I was also a little sad that Scott Pask -- eligible for five nods -- was completely overlooked. He didn't make Harvey Weinstein size headlines, but his was perhaps the most egregious sub. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut more than all of this, I was surprised at one thing that happened before the nominations and one thing that happened after the nominations.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI thought that Heidi Thomas' \\u003Cem\\u003EGigi\\u003C/em\\u003E book had a good shot at eligibility, but the Administration Committee ruled it ineligible. These things are up to the  Administration Committee to decide. With score, there are some parameters. As a matter of fact, early in my career, they ruled Jason Robert Brown and others were ineligible for the score for \\u003Cem\\u003EUrban Cowboy\\u003C/em\\u003E, which was a mix of old and new songs. I immediately called the show spokesperson and the Tony folks because I knew that over 50% of the songs in that show were written for the stage -- those songwriters should have been eligible. They reversed their ruling. But that was a case where they were looking at a precise guideline: over 50%. What makes a new book is much more discretionary. Here, they just didn't think \\u003Cem\\u003EGigi\\u003C/em\\u003E's libretto was new enough to warrant eligibility. Arguing would be superfluous. (And she likely wouldn't have received a nomination anyway, so this exercise is merely academic.) \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn terms of after the nominations, I was surprised at how overtly a conflict reared its ugly head. Prior to the nominations, I had written about \\u003Ca href=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cara-joy-david/the-tony-awards-who-nomin_b_7109426.html\\u003Enew Tony rules\\u003C/a\\u003E which defined when a nominator had to recuse him/herself. I questioned whether Rick Elice or Jenny Gersten had conflicts but were still being allowed to nominate under these new rules. I noted then that I was using Elice and Gersten as examples, not an exhaustive list of everyone with a conflict. One other such person who I could have pointed out as having a possible conflict was nominator Philip Himberg, Artistic Director of the Sundance Institute Theatre Program. \\u003Cem\\u003EFun Home\\u003C/em\\u003E was developed at Sundance. Well, shortly after the nominations, Himberg retweeted a Sundance Institute tweet which read: \\\"Congrats to #SundanceTheatre-supported @funhomemusical on 12 #TonyAward noms!\\\" What screams conflict more than that? Now, before the new rule was enacted, Elice recused himself in the face of the exact same conflict he faced this season. Himberg didn't recuse himself last season either, despite another Sundance project, \\u003Cem\\u003EA Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder\\u003C/em\\u003E, being eligible. Last season he also tweeted his congrats to \\\"Sundance alum musical Gentleman's Guide.\\\" One cannot blame this new rule for his staying on as a nominator. But was his participation in either year fair? He clearly takes pride in Sundance's shows being nominated, and he's one of the few doing the nominating. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T13:51:52-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cara-joy-david/the-tony-nominations-refl_b_7234250.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cara-joy-david/the-tony-nominations-refl_b_7234250.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 17:51:52 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Tony Nominations: Reflections A Week Later"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:01:37 UTC +00:00]]

I recently got an opportunity to have a long discussion with him in his studio about, painting, women, race, music, barbershops, the human condition and more painting. Here is an abridged version exclusively for readers of the Huffington Post.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E____________\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: I think all these paintings have a high amount of intimacy. The intimacy I'm sensing maybe because you trying to catch that honest moment. Perhaps a certain kind of honesty- if I'm reading it correctly, this intimacy comes out of this honest moment where you capture something real and you create an intimacy with the viewer. So the viewer feels perhaps that they are stepping into something light. They don't seem like they are people's private moments. Everyone seems very carefree. Maybe its because they are your friends and they trust you. They know you are going to make a really great picture.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Yeah, also I think the intimacy comes from a certain level of respect. All these paintings are based on my own photographs. In the same way we are having a conversation now, is the same way I have conversations with these women and I'm hoping to get something natural.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: And you do at some point. You take enough shots, it happens.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: This is one of the first ones, turned into a personal favorite and she's a spectacular writer.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E____________\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430949712-3805796-73dedadc7b4aa74e1f17a057d8ae8417.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430949712-3805796-73dedadc7b4aa74e1f17a057d8ae8417.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430949712-3805796-73dedadc7b4aa74e1f17a057d8ae8417-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"498\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Let me ask you has your work always been figurative or is this a narrowing down process where you figured out the thing you wanted to do?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I think this is a narrowing down process of me honing in on the technical aspect of my approach. My work started off as more political one-sheet posters, graphic, a little bit more illustrative. Ok then let me try my hand at academic figurative study. I love looking at people. I love looking at the way people move, and how they act and respond. Let me focus on people. And I'm somewhat of a perfectionist so I wanted to get that down and then who knows where this is going to carry me, but right now this is the focus. I am working on some abstract paintings right now. Trying my hand at that. (Doing that) Simultaneously while I'm working on figurative work. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: In the background here (pointing to portraits peaking out behind paintings) there seems to be a few men. Now I'm surrounded in a room full of portraits of beautiful women. By the way I don't know if all your friends are beautiful like this, but we should hang out more.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: (laughing) Amen brother, because a lot of these women are single and I'm just saying. They are always asking, \\\"Ajamu-don't you know any single guys? Any available men?\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: (laughing) So anyway there's a couple of men tucked in here. In fact they are very tucked away.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: They are.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Who are the men and why not as many men?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: You know what? Actually it may surprise you; in fact it's already in the pipeline where men are the focal point. You know, like I said, I'm already working on some abstract paintings. That's also in the room. So you got a little bit of everything here. That's probably not the answer you were looking for.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E____________\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: I don't know\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.barkleyhendricks.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E Barkley Hendricks \\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Oh man, you gotta get on him.

He's a wonderful painter. Who else do you think about?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I think about \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.matiklarweinart.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMati Klarwein\\u003C/a\\u003E. He's the most famous artist you never knew. Did a lot of album cover art. He does a lot of fantastical art.

Miles Davis's \\u003Cem\\u003EBitches Brew\\u003C/em\\u003E, I was like who the fuck painted that shit?!?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: He clearly did a lot of acid.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Once I figured out who he was, I started figuring out who he was and started buying buys books on him. Trying to find out who it was. I finally found someone who taught the technique he used out in Austria.  So off to Austria I was.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: What is Mischtechnik?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: It's called the Mischtichnik. Which is basically the mix technique that is egg tempera and oil glazes. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: The egg acts as a binder. It allows the oiled based painting to interact with the tempera base.  Why Mischtechnik. It seems like a serious commitment to go to Austria to learn something very specific.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I was like, I gotta do that. Get my passport and travel outside of the United States.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Whom did you admire when you started to gain an insight into the craft you were honing? So when I learned about Mati, he uses this technique. I wanted to paint like him. Then you find your own way.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: When I used to paint as a teenager I wanted to be Salvador Dali. I would drop acid and trip out on Dali. I think he's a good first painter for young people.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n(Klarwein) went to Dali to show him his paintings. He wanted to get put on.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: That makes sense.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Dali's response was, \\\"You're too religious.\\\" (laughs) So yeah-I wanted to paint like him. Then you realize years down the road that I don't want to paint like him, but I want to embody that spirit.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E____________\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Listening to Sun Ra is a little different than listening to other jazz. Don't you think? I like the spacey stuff.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK:I don't remember how I got turned on to Sun Ra's music which by the way is going to be a series I'm going to do.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: We were talking about influences before. Let's talk about these three painters. We spoke about Mati Klarwein..\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSleP8tawIM\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EPietro Anigonni\\u003C/a\\u003E, and Barkley Hendricks.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: So, are those like your top 3? Or three to matter to you in this time?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: For now. These are the three that permeate.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Right now. All figurative guys.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EGerhard Richter \\u003C/a\\u003Eis influencing my move into abstract painting.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: He was a huge influence on me.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Simultaneously with figurative. I am into Gerhard Richter right now.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Yeah and you want to bring a certain surface quality to it too. Your paintings are painted in a rigid academic style. I think your recent experiments with abstract painting; do you see that as a way to free yourself up? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I need a foundation at least, and then maybe once I become a little more comfortable I will be a little more spontaneous. It's nice to have that little safety net. It's a growing process. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: There's a great quote in the documentary about the punk band The Minutemen and Mike Watt is like, \\\"We didn't even know you had to tune your guitars.\\\" We didn't know that was a thing. I'm paraphrasing. He's like, \\\"Some guys like their strings loose and other guys like their strings tight.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: (laughs)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: So I look at these paintings and I think, this guy likes his strings tight. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: You know what it is with me and it's always been this way with me since I was a child is finding a balance. Maybe the abstract is the loose and this is the tighter. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: the grounds on these are loose. There's a real brushy element in the backgrounds so they are not flat. They photograph with a little depth but you see it more so in person. The photographs flatten your backgrounds more.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: It's difficult to get all that texture in there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E____________\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430950162-4306108-ad2c20c7b0ad43fdb085adae412aeb5b.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430950162-4306108-ad2c20c7b0ad43fdb085adae412aeb5b.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430950162-4306108-ad2c20c7b0ad43fdb085adae412aeb5b-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Is the political element still (present)?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: It's returning.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Do you think painting black women is a political statement onto itself? There are other kinds of women here, but it's mostly black women. Maybe because that's mostly who you hang out with?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: mm-hmm\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: so it is a political act?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I don't think black people are represented as often as they need to be. This is just my personal opinion. In paintings specifically and then to have black women, who in western society as Zora Neale Hurston would say are the \\\"Mule of the earth\\\". Whom we are all begat from until proven otherwise. It's such a contradiction, it's who we come from and women from color are treated as... at least in the United States.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: In a country dominated by white males, it's threatingly opposite to the white male.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Not only that...\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: these paintings are about empowerment.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Yes, men and not only white men, I guess I could say white men, but men are so insecure that they structure a society that oppresses women. So I'm taking a woman who comes from a society; a matrilineal society where the king's son can't be king but the king's sister's son can be king and is passed down as the one. Dude, I got a Jewish woman on canvas, I got a Latina woman on canvas, but black women are the women I come from.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: I see it both ways. It's about empowerment. It's about empowering the black woman whom is often mistreated in patriarchical society. It's also an act of convenience because these are the people in your life. So there is the journalistic aspect concerning people who you know in your world, yet who happen to be women you want to empower because they are representative to something larger in society.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Yes, we want to see human beings excel and evolve, but who doesn't want to see their family. If we are going to split hairs and say these people we are calling white and these people we are calling black. You want your people to feel good. Especially if they have been oppressed as long as they have been oppressed.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Sitting in a room full of oil paintings of mostly black women and we talk about race, right? If we were sitting in a room is a room of (paintings) white women, would we be talking about race right away?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: If we were both black, we probably would be. If we were both white, probably not.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: since I'm the weird mix I am, whatever I could be identified with, and you are black we ended up at that place or because if we were both white guys, would it be the same conversation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I don't know, but I know as a black man race related issues are on my mind everyday. So maybe I steered that a little bit? (laughs)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: It's interesting; I don't feel one way or the other about it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I like talking about race, especially with someone who is not black.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Me too.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: You like to push the envelope. (laughs)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: (laughs) you bet I do and why not?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: It's boring otherwise.

We were having a conversation on Girls (TV show we work on sometimes) and you checked in and were like showing mad respect, You wanted to make sure that didn't get to (uncomfortable).\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: It did get far out. We were joking about Hitler in black face which I still find funny.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: Most people don't even check in. sometimes it's because they are assholes, or sometimes they are just ignorant and don't know any better. You got to educate people on etiquette. C'mon, you gonna say some wild shit like that in 2015?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: The thing with me is that, all the humor is done with love and respect. It's just how I feel.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: You're educated. Some people are not.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: In your personal life, how politically active are you? Do you feel like the work is the protest?

It may be more apparent in my work because it's cathartic to me. Every day you wake up and walk out the door you will deal with some sort of political bullshit. Or feel as though you have to.

Here's one: The art world. How involved are you?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I'm a baby, man, it was a little discouraging at first. OK, I'm just not figuring it out. We've spoken about this before. I wanted to be a filmmaker and you wanted to be a painter and here doing the opposite things. Which makes perfect sense. So (the art world) is sorta new for me. I knew that it's always been there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: As far as your level of engagement?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I'm looking at it like, fuck-I've waited this long. I saw an interview with Toni Morrison and I don't know the full story, but the abridged version is she didn't start writing until she was 40. She's a Nobel Prize winner.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: Yeah man, like deKooning didn't sell a painting until he was 47. I know you got one up on him. I feel the same about my own work; a lot of it is a social business.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: It's also about when you mature into a certain level of command over your craft, or knowledge, or confidence. It's like what the fuck am I fucking around for? I know I'm a badass at this shit. So you start projecting it and people start noticing it. So that's happening and it happens when it's supposed to happen or whatever the fuck that means.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E____________\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430950740-6745438-TZqZMRrAhZmU8xWC.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430950740-6745438-TZqZMRrAhZmU8xWC.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430950740-6745438-TZqZMRrAhZmU8xWC-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"412\\\" height=\\\"480\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: You ever think about doing anything else?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAK: I don't know what else to do though.

I never went to a barbershop. If I needed a haircut my pop was cutting my hair. Since I already had that interest in art, draftsmanship, the language translated. So then I started thinking about designs. I would sketch it out on a crudely shaped head. I was like wow- you can draw pictures in this textured hair. (laughs) Hell, it's on now. My little brother was into Teenage Ninja Turtles and he asked me to cut one of them motherfuckers into the back of his head. So he was going to school with the flyest haircuts in Little Rock Arkansas. (laughs)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMN: (Laughs) I love this story. I remember this (cultural) moment too.

For we are storytelling animals and thus learn who we are by recounting and listening to stories.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Prodigal Father Wayward Son: A Roadmap to Reconciliation\\\" is a series of stories/reframings told by Gifford and Sam in alternating chapters. The beginning of the book exposes both men's most painful childhood memories - I found some of the episodes almost too painful to read and had to put the book down on at least one occasion.  However, the recounting of these stories also shows how a handful of interludes can warp the lenses through which father and son see each other.  As Gifford writes to Sam, \\\"Like a bad habit or an addiction, these few harsh images stood sentinel at the entryway to memory and experience, restricting my responses to you to a very narrow range.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOnce the unconscious myths that poisoned their relationship are exposed, Sam and Gifford branch out into unexplored territory, narrating the unshared stories of how they came to be the men they are.  In the end, this leads to remarkable acts of forgiveness and reconciliation. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe prescription is daunting, but it seems both profound and obvious that authentic sharing of our narratives is a precondition to reconciliation.

What was it like watching it?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRight. The stuff [the show] did in prison was just really disturbing. I think I realized at that point I genuinely have a little PTSD from it. I knew I had it, but the surreality of it just made it more pronounced because who in the world gets so bothered by just images of women in prison? [...] At first I didn’t know if I would actually like the show, but I had a morbid curiosity. Probably the same morbid curiosity that got me in trouble in the first place. So I kept watching.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDid you continue to watch through Season 2?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOh, yeah.

The plot diverges so completely, especially in terms of my character. Then it just was entertainment.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWere you grateful that it diverged so much?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYeah. I didn’t want to see a perfect adaptation of my actual life unfold in front of me. I don’t play front and center in [Piper's] book at all, there’s barely a mention of me. So when Alex’s character does play front and center so much in the first season I was like, \\\"Wow, okay. This is weird.\\\" They’re creating this whole fictitious person based on me.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAnd the whole romance plot between Alex and Piper wasn’t real, right?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nRight.

We had breakfast together. She’s read my book. We’re on good terms. I don’t know what she thinks about the book yet, though.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAt what point did you decide to write your memoir?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter the [Vanity Fair] article came out, I was approached by a literary agent. Somebody wanted to do my memoir, but they were unaware of the fact that I was actually a writer, so I said, \\\"Well, I would love to do my memoir myself.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYou mention in it that you’d previously written a novel that’s a fictionalized account of your experiences.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI actually wrote three novels, a trilogy, in prison. Some of them I actually wrote on rolls of toilet paper. I have little sheets of toilet papers with chapters on them. I managed to write three 600-page novels.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDo you think you’d have written this had it not been for Piper’s book or the show?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNo, I would not. I was not a non-fiction writer and I don’t think I was ready to look at my own story as closely as you have to do. One of the things that was really hard was being honest with myself and reliving some of those experiences. A lot of it I just blocked out of my mind. The only way I can actually convey to the reader the -- I want you to be there, to feel it. I want you to know what that is like so you never go there and so you have more empathy for the people who do go there. We’ve got 800 percent more women in prison than we did in 1987, it’s all because of the drug wars. These women have kids and these kids are growing up without parents and these kids are going to end up in the system too. We can’t just put everyone in jail.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWith regard to the show, did Netflix every consult you?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNo. I would be happy to, but I doubt that they will if they haven’t already. It almost feels like it’s an inconvenience that I’m an actual human being. Because they haven’t reached out. It surprises me that people in that production company are not sensitive to the fact that when you do use real-life characters, that even though it’s fiction, if you are a hit show that you are going to impact those real-life character’s lives. A head’s up would’ve been nice. But they must have had reasons not to, and I can’t imagine that those reasons are very altruistic. I would never have gotten in the way of their production, but then again I was so stubbornly under my rock [then] I might have thrown a fit. And really in the end, it was the greatest thing anyone’s done for me, to shove me out of that closet and get rid of my secrets.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat are you hoping for now that the book is out?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI would love it if I could be a writer and a technologist. That would make everything in my life suddenly make perfect sense, why I had to go through all of that. But to be a writer and to get to publish a book and have the opportunity to reach so many people is the coolest thing since Wonder Bread. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThis interview had been edited and condensed.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCleary Wolters' \\u003Cem\\u003EOut of Orange\\u003C/em\\u003E is out now and available on \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Out-Orange-Memoir-Cleary-Wolters/dp/0062376136\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EAmazon\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T11:15:00-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/cleary-wolters-out-of-orange_n_7226614.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/cleary-wolters-out-of-orange_n_7226614.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:15:00 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Cleary Wolters, The Real Alex Vause, Shares Her Story For The First Time"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:01:37 UTC +00:00]]

Shaffer was asked what he saw for Letterman's post-midnight \\\"Late Night\\\" on NBC, keeping in mind they could only afford a few musicians. He envisioned something like the lounge bands he saw at the beginning of his career in Toronto, a lead keyboard player and a couple of other instruments, interpreting Stax and Motown hits.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n              \\u003Cp\\u003ELetterman said that sounded great, that he'd always thought of himself as the Wayne Cochran of comedy.

He's had the freedom to do other things while the \\\"Late Show\\\" let him lead a band — perform in front of an audience, do sketch comedy and match wits with TV's hottest host. That's not to say it was always easy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n              \\u003Cp\\u003E\\\"I spent time preparing funny, off-the-wall lines, something Jerry Lewis had said, for example,\\\" he said. \\\"I was doing quite well with it, I thought.

As anyone who's been in his frigid studio knows, he's a host who likes things Just So. Shaffer will interject quick remarks — \\\"Instagram that right away,\\\" he said after his boss took a selfie Tuesday night — or lead the band into a snippet of \\\"Tequila\\\" for a Top Ten list about Cinco de Mayo parties. Sometimes it's as simple as breaking the silence, an \\\"ahh\\\" or slight cackle.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n              \\u003Cp\\u003ELetterman has a habit of calling a pre-show meeting just when there's too little time to seriously discuss things.

Books have the power to teach us about ourselves and the world around us.  They can open up doors to new ideas, new outlooks, and fresh experiences.  The best books deal with complicated, important, and often times controversial topics.  Literature can be beautiful and unsettling all at once.  When a writer puts his/her inner thoughts on the page to comment about the world we live in, it is a gift for all people to learn from and enjoy.  There is nothing more raw than honest words in the pages of a great novel.  With that rawness and creative freedom, there comes a price.  Certain groups and individuals view some works of literature as detrimental instead of a valuable addition to the world.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBook banning is not a new concept, as governments and educational institutions have been banning books in America since the 1600's.  Defining books such as \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Great Gatsby, The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beloved, 1984, The Lord of the Flies, The Color Purple, The Grapes of Wrath\\u003C/em\\u003E, and many others have been banned for various reasons.  All of these books are also staples in American schools today and have been for many years.  These books have undoubtedly inspired and changed countless amounts of lives from being taught as part of school curriculums.  Banning books contradicts First Amendment Rights, but it does not stop groups from trying to ban certain works, even in today's saturated entertainment and technological world.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nParents of schools in Idaho and North Carolina currently want John Steinbeck's classic, \\u003Cem\\u003EOf Mice and Men\\u003C/em\\u003E, and Khaled Hosseini's modern triumph, \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Kite Runner\\u003C/em\\u003E, banned from their respective high schools.  \\u003Cem\\u003EOf Mice and Men\\u003C/em\\u003E is facing adversity due to coarse language and dark themes.  While \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Kite Runner\\u003C/em\\u003E is being accused of having too many adult themes and portraying women in a negative light.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs a book lover, this is undeniably outrageous.  As a human being, this is incredibly disheartening knowing that the opportunity to learn about different cultures and times in an extremely beneficial and increasingly scarce art form, the written word, is being threatened by groups of misguided individuals.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nQuestions for the parents who want these books banned: Do your kids have cell phones?  Access to the internet and social media?  Video games?  Cable television?  If the answer is yes to any of those questions, then your kid is learning about the world already through less tasteful venues.  They are forming their own views of the world around them based on what they watch on television and read on the internet, and it's likely that they are not getting the whole picture while being exposed to much more inappropriate material then they will ever read about in a piece of literature assigned in the classroom.  Quite frankly, supporters of banning books are trying to steal from their child's education, place them in a bubble, and refrain from allowing them to see the world as it really was and is from different perspectives.  All the while, either unbeknownst to them, or just unwilling to admit it, their children are already being exposed to exactly what they are trying to keep away from them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EOf Mice and Men\\u003C/em\\u003E shows a different time in an incredibly real light, that cannot be learned from modern day society.  As they say, in order to not repeat the past, we must learn from it, and while the short novel has strong themes, it is a great tool for teaching about our past mistakes.  \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Kite Runner\\u003C/em\\u003E shows how life was and very much still is growing up in The Middle East.  With so much tension between America and The Middle East, \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Kite Runner\\u003C/em\\u003E is arguably one of the most important books to teach in classrooms today because it humanizes a region that some Americans have such disdain towards because of the minority portion of bad people who call that region home.  If anything, it shows how lucky we are as a nation to have the rights that we have in a free world, and provides a means to empathize with an area that is still progressing towards equality and freedom for all.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIronically, as an author, having a book banned, is usually a good thing for sales as well as notoriety.  Banned books bring attention to the root problems whether the people advocating the ban realize it or not.  Discussion commences on the major issues of the work in question, but banning them does not solve the problem.  See, because the only way to truly shed light on the controversy is to read the book, to learn from its themes, and gain a new outlook on the world and how to make it better for everyone.  Authors whose books have been banned by governments and in schools should feel a sense of pride since they created something that sparks a response.  We owe it to the author to respond to the work by learning not avoiding the themes as a whole.  If we act like the themes of banned books do not exist then we are denying the truth that the world was never perfect and it never will be.  The best that we can do is take the time to read great pieces of literature, and form our own opinions on how change can arise.  We should read and then act instead of not reading these books at all. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T13:09:13-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-petite/banning-books-in-the-21st_b_7228274.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-petite/banning-books-in-the-21st_b_7228274.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 17:09:13 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Banning Books in the 21st Century"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:03:12 UTC +00:00]]

The lesson was never to trust Dick Cheney again. But there was an additional lesson we needed to learn and didn't. The lesson was that we shouldn't presume to know the thoughts of foreign people with whom we have had little direct contact. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow do I know we didn't learn this lesson? It's clear from the poll results that have come out in the last month since the U.S. and Iran agreed on a framework for removing sanctions over Iran's nuclear program. While most commentators have focused on the broad support the public has given the agreement -- \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/poll-2-to-1-support-for-nuclear-deal-with-iran/2015/03/30/9a5a5ac8-d720-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E59 percent approve and 31 percent disapprove\\u003C/a\\u003E -- what's more significant is that so many people (90 percent) seem to have an opinion at all. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch4\\u003E\\\"Given the way our brain is wired, we believe we can divine how other people think.\\\"\\u003C/h4\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat's alarming given that that the details of the framework are both secret and in dispute (the Iranians and Americans \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/01/marco-rubio/iran-united-states-disagree-nuclear-deal-framework/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Econtinue to spar\\u003C/a\\u003E over what was agreed to) and given that it's plainly unclear what the Iranians' intentions are. The only honest answer about Iran's intentions at this point is: we don't know.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat, unfortunately, is not something we are likely to admit. Why? Because given the way our brain is wired, we believe we can divine how other people think. Because our brain evolved during a period when we lived in small groups consisting of people who knew each other so intimately that we developed confidence in our ability to read other people's intentions. An alarm bell should go off when we aren't in a position to be able to do so; but it doesn't. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnother related human bias is affecting how people are assessing the framework -- particularly people who support it. Our \\\"projection bias\\\" leads us to believe that other people think like we do. In this case, we think that if we were in Iran's position, we'd gladly restrict our nuclear program to get rid of sanctions that are hobbling the economy and making life miserable. That just strikes us as common sense. NPR's Steve Inskeep reflected this view in his recent interview with President Obama. Lifting of the sanctions, the journalist \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/2015/04/07/397933577/transcript-president-obamas-full-npr-interview-on-iran-nuclear-deal\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Enoted\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\\"is widely anticipated to cause a lot of economic growth in Iran. Iranian business people are already banking on this.\\\" See, they're just like us.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch4\\u003E\\\"Our 'projection bias' leads us to believe that other people think like we do.\\\"\\u003C/h4\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nUnfortunately, what may seem like common sense to us may not seem so to Iranians, particularly the hardliners. Other considerations may rank higher. But this is a hard lesson to learn, and once again, it's because we evolved in small groups.  We didn't develop an instinct against what social scientists call mirroring since anybody we encountered was likely to think pretty much as we did.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA warning against the bias is prominently addressed in \\u003Cem\\u003EPsychology of Intelligence Analysis\\u003C/em\\u003E, which was published by an arm of the CIA. But knowing about the bias doesn't offer protection against it. \\u003Cem\\u003EPsychology of Intelligence Analysis\\u003C/em\\u003E was published in 1999, four years before the agency (and Dick Cheney) argued that Iraqis would welcome our invasion against Saddam.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCareful journalists \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2015/0404/Americans-support-Iran-nuclear-deal-but-with-major-reservations-video\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ehave noted\\u003C/a\\u003E that the polls indicate that two-thirds of Americans are skeptical an agreement would stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. This suggests that Americans have a sophisticated understanding of Iran, balancing an optimistic outlook against a well-earned cynicism.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch4\\u003E\\\"The only honest answer about Iran's intentions at this point is: we don't know.\\\"\\u003C/h4\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nActually, what it more likely is that after decades of acrimony (remember, Iran was considered part of the \\\"axis of evil\\\"), most of us remain suspicious of Iranians, particularly since they don't look or dress like most of us, yet another legacy of our Stone Age evolution.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe history of the last forty or so years suggests that we don't understand Iran in 2015 any better than we understood Iraq in 2003 or Vietnam in 1965.

Kempner -- professor and affiliate of the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research at Rutgers University -- has personal experience with migraine attacks, which started for her at 5 years old.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSince I was \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://reciperenovator.com/menieres-disease-migraine-update/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ediagnosed last year with migraine and Meniere's disease\\u003C/a\\u003E, I've been working on a migraine-friendly diet plan and book. I was fascinated to find Kempner's book, which asks the pointed question: \\u003Cem\\u003EDoes migraine treatment and research get slighted because it's primarily women who suffer?\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMore than 75 percent of migraine sufferers are female, and Kempner's premise is that this gender inequity makes an enormous difference in how migraine is studied and treated, as well as how migraine drugs are marketed. Her book traces the history of migraine, the perception of the \\\"migraine personality\\\" in literature, how treatment has evolved, and the attitudes expressed about patients in both the medical literature and recent best-selling books on migraine. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nShe tackles such meaty topics as how pharma companies play on women's guilt about failing at their family duties, how the recent shift to seeing migraine as a neurological spectrum disorder has legitimized both headache doctors and researchers, and the rise of the patient advocate.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was challenged by the book, both to address my own biases and my personal experience as a patient, to re-think my response to migraine books and articles, and to question terminology. Kempner's book put my own experience into context.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI liked Kempner's even-handed approach, especially where she describes the positives and negatives of seeing oneself as having a \\\"migraine brain.\\\" The recent shift from viewing migraine as a psychological problem to a neurological one has advantages, bringing legitimacy and possibly research dollars to what's now believed to a be complex neurological disorder.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nKempner outlines the down side, too. Focusing solely on neurology limits the potential for other areas of study and treatment, one of which may provide a part of the answer to this complex puzzle. The broken brain concept can develop into a personal identity for migraine sufferers. One indicator of this is the adoption of the term \\u003Cem\\u003Emigraineur\\u003C/em\\u003E by the migraine community. She, as do I, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://migraine.com/blog/who-are-we-anyway/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Equestions the usefulness of this term\\u003C/a\\u003E, as it implies an identity that cannot easily be set aside.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EI caught up with Kempner to ask her some questions:\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow have physicians and migraine researchers responded to the book?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"\\u003Cem\\u003EI've been really pleased at how well received the book has been in medicine. Headache specialists have told me that they find my book helpful in their efforts to reduce the stigma of headache disorders. Dr. William Young, at Jefferson Headache Clinic, has been particularly supportive and we've even conducted some research on migraine and stigma together.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYou made some challenging statements about pharma companies and advertising.

Corporate influence is an endemic problem in medicine. The problem in headache medicine is that headache specialists have few alternatives -- there is so little non-industry funding available for headache research, they have no choice but to accept pharmaceutical funding.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo, no, I haven't had any backlash or heard any critiques.

I don't like the term \\\"migraineur\\\" because I think it conflates the person with the migraine. \\\"Migraineur\\\" makes it sound the person is actively migraineing. I'm taking a cue from the disability rights movement on this one. Just like \\\"person with epilepsy\\\" is generally preferable to \\\"epileptic,\\\" I think \\\"person with migraine\\\" is preferable to \\\"migraineur.\\\" In general, those who disagree do so for aesthetic reasons -- \\\"migraineur\\\" sounds more elegant, whereas \\\"person with migraine\\\" can sound awkward.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat is your biggest takeaway from writing the book?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"\\u003Cem\\u003EHard question!

Altschuler\",\"description\":\"\\u003Cem\\u003EReview of \\u003Cem\\u003EInequality:  What Can Be Done?\\u003C/em\\u003E  By Anthony B. Atkinson.  Harvard University Press. 384 pp. $29.95\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMore than 80 years ago, during the Great Depression, R.H. Tawney asserted that \\\"while inequality is easy, since it demands no more than to float with the current, equality is difficult, for it involves swimming against it... it has its price and its burdens.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn \\u003Cem\\u003EInequality\\u003C/em\\u003E, Sir Anthony Atkinson, a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a founder of modern inequality studies, elaborates on and qualifies Tawney's claim.  Since the 1980s, Atkinson reminds us, income inequality in the United States and the United Kingdom has increased substantially.  And in a poll recently conducted by the Pew Research Center, citizens of these two countries deemed it \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/10/16/middle-easterners-see-religious-and-ethnic-hatred-as-top-global-threat/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\\"the greatest danger to the world.\\\"\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nConvinced that excessive inequality is unjust and has bad consequences on social cohesion, political participation, and economic growth, Atkinson is intent on stimulating a national conversation about the distribution of income.  He maintains that inequality is \\\"not the product of forces over which we have no control.\\\"  Government policies have contributed to inequality and government can take steps reduce it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAtkinson makes 15 proposals designed to return to the levels achieved before \\\"the Inequality Turn\\\" in the 1980s.  They include:  encouraging innovation in a form that increases employment; laws to facilitate union representation of workers; guaranteed public employment at a minimum wage (set at a living wage); national savings bonds that guarantee a positive real rate of interest; a capital endowment (national inheritance) paid to all at adulthood; the creation of a sovereign wealth fund; a return to a more progressive personal income tax, with a top rate of 65%; a progressive lifetime gift and inheritance tax; a substantial Child Benefit paid to all children; a \\\"participation income\\\" paid to anyone making \\\"a social contribution\\\"; a substantial increase in the levels of social insurance; and an allocation of 1% of the gross national income of wealthy countries to development assistance to poor countries.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAtkinson tries to refute the \\\"standard objections\\\" of critics.  Citing evidence from the past and employing a theoretical examination of possible impacts, he insists that there are insufficient grounds for blanket claims that his proposals, if implemented, would lower economic output and reduce growth.  Higher wages, for example, might increase productivity; proposals to help small savers could increase wealth accumulation and investment.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nPointing out that the original welfare state had its origins in a period of globalization, Atkinson identifies evidence of growing international cooperation on environmental protection, finance, and women's rights.  Moreover, pressure on banks to disclose the accounts and investments of foreigners to the appropriate authorities in the countries in which they have tax liabilities is beginning to produce results.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFinally, Atkinson emphasizes that given the progressivity of the tax rates he supports, his recommendations (if applied to the United Kingdom) could be revenue neutral.  By achieving \\\"a salient reduction\\\" in overall inequality, overall poverty, and child poverty, he suggests, his reform package could contribute mightily to a functioning democracy and a good society.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHaving concluded that \\\"it is remarkably difficult to shift people's opinions if they are carrying in their heads\\\" fixed -- and flawed -- theoretical conceptions, Atkinson did not focus all that much on empirical evidence of how his proposals would work \\\"in reality.\\\"  And he acknowledges that many readers may feel that (except for his attempt to refute the \\\"corrosive\\\" claim that nothing can be done) he has devoted insufficient attention to politics.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThese two decisions, it seems to me, make it far less likely that his proposals will get traction beyond the diminished and discouraged cohort of unreconstructed New Dealers in the United States and \\\"Back to Beveridge\\\" [the 1942 plan for social security] reformers in the United Kingdom.  Critics will surely dismiss \\u003Cem\\u003EInequality\\u003C/em\\u003E as \\\"the same-old-same-old\\\" litany of liberal bromides.  They will claim that at a time in which the U.S. and the U.K. are struggling to reduce government deficits, Atkinson's recommendations will require massive additions to an already bloated bureaucracy; throw money at problems with little or no control over how it will be spent; create disincentives to work and a culture of entitlements; force businesses and individual creators of wealth to re-locate; and send jobs abroad.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nExcept for climate change, inequality is, indeed, the greatest danger to our world.  For many reasons, reducing it should be on everyone's agenda.  Anthony Atkinson deserves great credit for attempting to stimulate a national conversation -- and for demonstrating that some \\\"solutions to these problems lie in our hands.\\\"  That said, it is important to recognize that in the 1980s Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher changed the political discourse about equality of opportunity, inequality, and the role of government in regulating the economy, redistributing income, and providing a social safety net.  It ain't easy, these days to swim against the current -- and head upstream. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T11:14:06-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-c-altschuler/the-greatest-danger-to-th_b_7231102.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-c-altschuler/the-greatest-danger-to-th_b_7231102.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:14:06 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Greatest Danger to the World"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:03:12 UTC +00:00]]

Often, specific problems arise with regard to crafting translations from French, German, Russian, Italian, and other languages so that a word or phrase translated from its original cultural context can be understood by today's theatregoers.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor many years, opera companies would try to perform works like Johann Strauss II's 1874 operetta, \\u003Cem\\u003EDie Fledermaus\\u003C/em\\u003E, and his subsequent \\u003Cem\\u003EWiener Blut\\u003C/em\\u003E (1899) -- as well as Franz Lehar's popular \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Merry Widow\\u003C/em\\u003E (1905) in English translations which often fell short of the mark. During the late 20th century, Andrew Porter's English translations of 37 operas (including \\u003Cem\\u003EDer Ring des Nibelungen\\u003C/em\\u003E) were used by numerous opera companies. Soon after Lotfi Mansouri introduced the use of Supertitles at the Canadian Opera Company for a 1983 production of Richard Strauss's \\u003Cem\\u003E Elektra\\u003C/em\\u003E, the new technology proved to be a game changer.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ciframe width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"375\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eu52_j-m5_Q\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003E\\u003C/iframe\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSince then, more and more operas have been performed in their original languages with Supertitles written in the language most familiar to the audience. In 1987, having just experienced Wagner's \\u003Cem\\u003ERing\\u003C/em\\u003E at the Seattle Opera, I flew to Aarhus for the Danish National Opera's production of \\u003Cem\\u003EDer Ring des Nibelungen\\u003C/em\\u003E, fully anticipating another production with the use of Supertitles.

With some inspired tinkering, could plays that were 350 and 119 years old (and written for wildly different cultures) be made accessible to modern audiences?

Although I read it in college, the text was not particularly exciting for me. On May 27, 1980, I attended the world premiere of Kirke Mechem's operatic adaptation when the San Francisco Opera debuted \\u003Cem\\u003ETartuffe\\u003C/em\\u003E at the Herbst Theatre. In the spring of 1988, I traveled to Oregon to catch two more performances of Mechem's \\u003Cem\\u003ETartuffe\\u003C/em\\u003E at the Eugene Opera.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs often happens with college productions, the comedy was quite polite and never reached the biting sarcasm that was one of Molière's strong points.

Those that do become the standard by which we measure ourselves, both culturally and artistically.

The final vote was 98 to 1, with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) as the lone no-show and junior Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) casting the only dissenting vote. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe final passage out of Senate came immediately after a separate vote to cut off further debate on non-germane amendments to the bill, to which over 70 proposed changes have been filed. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe move to abruptly end debate and bring the unamended bill up for a vote came after an unexpected procedural move by Cotton, who effectively jumped the line and forced a vote on a package of his own amendments. While his demands were relevant to the nuclear negotiations -- restrictions on sanctions relief and an assurance on “anytime, anywhere inspections” -- he also included a provision authored by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that would require Iran to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Israel provision was particularly offensive to supporters of the bill because aside from being non-germane to the nuclear negotiations, it put pro-Israel lawmakers in the difficult position of being forced to publicly vote down pro-Israel legislation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFaced with a scenario in which the Iran bill could not move forward until Cotton’s amendment package was addressed, McConnell grudgingly filed cloture on the bill Tuesday evening. The move opened him up for criticism from his Democratic colleagues, who accused him and his party of hypocrisy for berating Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for his tight control of the amendment process during his time as majority leader.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThursday’s vote to end debate was delayed by several hours in an attempt to give lawmakers extra time to carve out an agreement on a limited series of votes on amendments, before cutting off debate entirely.

Is the newly-minted closer worth the adulation and the money, or is the mystique just a myth?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor over a century baseball had nine positions on the field. Then came the designated hitter and more recently the feared closer. The DH is a specialist, playing only offense. The closer is a specialist too -- a relief pitcher coming to work the ninth inning with his team ahead by no more than three runs. But why is the ninth inning with a lead different than any other? It's not, but sports writer Jerome Holtzman came up with the concept of a \\\"save\\\" that gave rise to the closer, that led to the mystique of the closer, that led to exorbitantly high salaries. Mariano Rivera and Joe Nathan and lots of other closers owe Holtzman big time. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe closer is supposed to unnerve opposing batters. I am reminded of \\u003Cem\\u003EValdez\\u003C/em\\u003E, a B cowboy movie from the fifties.  Ads for the movie said \\\"Valdez is coming.\\\" Brave men shivered in their boots and women would run and hide. Now fanfare and music greet the closer and the opposing batters shiver in their spikes and meekly make outs. The mystique of the closer makes great drama, drains the team's coffers and increases the bank accounts of the closers. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe going rate for a recognized closer is $10-15 million per year, while other relief pitchers who may be just as good might get $5 million. Mariano Rivera and Joe Nathan have the highest close percentages of all time -- each saving about 89 percent of their opportunities over their careers.  Sounds good, but how important was that to their teams? Well, a baseball stat geek recently looked at every major league game in history. When a team leads by one run going into the ninth inning, it wins 86 percent of the time, 94 percent when winning by two runs, and 96 percent when winning by three runs. All of a sudden 89 percent for the very best of all time doesn't impress so much. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHow about the contribution of Mariano Rivera to the New York Yankees over his long tenure as their closer? During the 16 years (1997 through 2012), the Yankees had the best overall regular-season record in baseball. The Pirates had the worst record. Now the Pirates' closers over those 16 years were the famous and feared, what's their names? Right, I don't remember either. Anyway, if in those years the Yankees were leading going in the ninth inning they won 97.2 percent of their games, while the lowly Pirates only won 94.7 percent of theirs. This translates into about 1.5 games per year from the worst team to the best team; from a bunch of unremembered closers to the best ever.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn San Francisco where I live, for a few years there was \\\"fear the beard\\\" as Brian Wilson saved games and saved the day for the Giants. Fans loved the high drama, but did the Beard really make a difference? In 2010, Wilson was the closer and the Giants won the World Series. In 2012 he was injured and pitched in only two innings all season, so it was closer by committee. But the Giants won again. In 2013 the Giants had a new great closer in Sergio Romo (who saved 88 percent of his opportunities) and the Giants finished 16 games out in the National League West. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut what happened in 2011? At the start of the season Wilson was doing his usual job and had saved 35 out of 40 opportunities (87.5 percent). He was then injured and forced to miss over a month of the season, and the Giants fell out of contention while he was on the disabled list. During spring training the next season, the\\u003Cem\\u003E San Francisco Chronicle\\u003C/em\\u003E ran an article with the headline \\\"Giants Know High Cost of Losing Closer.\\\" Really, I wondered. So I did my homework. While Wilson was away the Giants' closers went seven out of eight, or 87.5 percent. Does that number sounds familiar? But wait. The one blown save that the Giants pitching staff had was in the seventh inning of one game. Wilson would not have pitched in the seventh-inning because he was \\\"the closer.\\\" This means to me that that while Wilson was away the ninth inning closers saved seven out of seven. Tough to beat that. So my conclusion is that had Wilson been healthy and pitched, the Giants could only have done worse.  Wow, that is a high cost!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Giants won again in 2014 despite losing their closer from 2013, Sergio Romo. They technically didn't lose him, but Romo's poor performance resulted in a demotion to becoming the setup man. Santiago Casilla took over the closer's role. Interestingly enough for 2014 both Romo and Casilla saved 82 percent of their opportunities. That's a low figure for ninth-inning closers, but did not keep the Giants out of postseason play.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEven the Atlanta Braves, who have been so smart in utilizing their pitchers over the years, couldn't resist falling for the myth of the closer. From 2001 through 2004 they turned John Smoltz, one of the great starting pitchers of his era, into their closer. Why would anyone in his right mind want to turn a superstar who consistently pitched effectively in over 200 innings per season into a closer who could be used for maybe 70 innings? Could the reason be perception and baseball lore and the facts be damned? In 2003 Smoltz went on the DL in September. Replacing him as closer were a few relievers and some starters seeking to reestablish themselves. During that September I happened to see a televised game in which one of the Braves' substitute closers saved the day. Nonetheless the television announcer dutifully informed all of us fans that the Braves was just not the same without Smoltz as the closer. He had been on the DL for 15 days at that point. Number of saves the Braves' pitching staff blew while he was out those 15 days -- zero, nada, rien, gar nicht.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMariano Rivera, the greatest closer of all time, retired from the Yankees at the end of the 2013 season. During his major league career he saved 89 percent of his chances. In his last year, 2013, he saved 86 percent of his chances. The prior two years were 84 percent and 90 percent. Could it be the reason the Yankees failed to make the playoffs in 2014 was the absence of Rivera? Guess not. In their bull pen, the Yankees found David Robertson, who became the new closer and miraculously saved 89 percent of his chances. In 2014 Robertson's salary was about $5 million less than the Yankees paid Rivera in 2013. It was about $10 million less than they paid Rivera in 2012. Proving once again that the graveyard is full of indispensable people.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe math tells us that the mystique of the closer is a myth. In reality, if the \\\"closer\\\" is the best relief pitcher, it would be better to use him with say, bases loaded and one out in the eighth inning and his team tied or down by one run than to save him for when his team is up two or three runs in the ninth. Still, the buzz and the drama probably won't go away anytime soon. People want to believe in something and what better than the closer? Never mind the stats. If I were general manger with $15 million to spend, I just might get three good relief pitchers and let them cheerfully share closing duties. Or maybe a good hitter or two would be a better investment. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI am reminded of the lyrics from a folk song from my youth: \\\"Oh, when will they ever learn?

In efforts to stop the heart attack, they unleashed something much worse. The blood thinner they administered at the small city hospital broke loose a clot in her brain. They rushed her an hour north. By the time we arrived, my mother-in-law was unresponsive. There was nothing we could do but wait.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe collective weight of suffering and worry among the ICU families was too much for my husband. He stayed outside. I sat near his dad and sister but hadn't a clue what to do with myself in these unbearable circumstances. So I did what I always do when I want to escape, I pulled a book from my bag. It was \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Purpose Driven Life\\u003C/em\\u003E, by Rick Warren, another impulse buy in my never-ending pursuit of purpose. In that moment, I felt more desperate than ever to understand the meaning of life, and now death... since it seemed to be knocking at our door.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI settled awkwardly back into my seat, opened to chapter one and read the first line. \\\"It's not about you,\\\" the author wrote.  A strange sense of relief flooded my body and I almost got lost in the comfort. An unfamiliar woman next to me began to cry and I was forced back into the reality of our situation. That day and the following 10 were the worst of my fairly young life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTwelve years ago this week, my mother-in-law passed on. I have relived those last few days of her life many times. Today, however, is the first time I remember reading Rick Warren's words, \\\"It's not about you,\\\" in the ICU waiting room. My marriage, my habits, my life choices were all in ill repair 12 years ago. Twelve years ago I was unemployed, because I had just resigned a stressful sales career to \\\"find myself.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's strange to consider my life in contrast now. A strong marriage, a beautiful son, and a job I love.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe first line of that book did change my life, but not the way you might think.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nPrior to reading that book, my search for purpose had taken on a self-absorbed slant. I had been focusing on what I wanted and needed to do with my life. After reading the book and watching my loved ones walk bravely through loss, my pendulum swung swiftly to the other side. I sought first and foremost to serve, even though I did not yet honestly know my own talents, temperaments and weaknesses well enough. Like a knight fighting for his king, I made it my sole \\\"purpose\\\" (to try) to save everyone else.  Having struggled my whole life to overcome people pleasing and perfectionism, this kind of service wore my soul thread bear.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut I did not want to look closely at the state of my serving. It was only years later, that the excruciating loss of my father-in-law caused me to deeply question my purpose again. His unconditional love had been such a respite for me, and I was suddenly without it. I wondered out loud and through angry tears, \\\"Why does my purpose crumble beneath me every time I start to believe I can put my weight on it?\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs I cried, an answer rose up from within, \\\"Because you cannot truly serve from your purpose until you learn to love yourself.\\\"  I felt The Spirit of God.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn that moment, I knew it was Truth. I did not love myself. The words I whispered in my private inner world were often cruel and condemning. I believed I could not love myself until I proved myself worthy. To be worth something, I needed a purpose, which constantly seemed to escape me. I was stuck in a vicious cycle of searching- going outside of me to find me -- and trying to save everyone else in order to save my fragile self.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI opened to Mark 12 and read from the Bible.  Jesus said, \\\"You should love God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.\\\" The second great commandment is this: Love others in the same way you love yourself. There are no commandments more important than these.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI used the verse like a microscope to examine the details of my life. I'd had the \\\"love God\\\" part down since I was little, clinging to God like a small child clings to a soft puppy until it yelps. And I've tried to love others in my own mixed up way.  But loving myself has been the hardest part.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter years of searching and struggling, I've found that Rick Warren was right. But it has taken me a long time to understand his proposition. While my purpose is not \\u003Cem\\u003Eabout\\u003C/em\\u003E me, being deeply okay with who I am \\u003Cem\\u003Eis\\u003C/em\\u003E at the core of it.  It requires my willingness to let God love me right where I am at any given moment. It takes a commitment to be gentle, kind, and patient with myself.  It is found in the freedom of becoming who I am \\u003Cem\\u003Ecreated\\u003C/em\\u003E to be.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd when I love myself, every moment of life becomes more purposeful. I am able to listen closely for God's voice within. I am able to joyfully and authentically serve others.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI've picked my purpose up and dropped it repeatedly throughout the years. Purpose has been slippery and hard to hold onto, because in secret places down deep, I didn't believe I deserved a purpose. My failures ran too wide, my guilt too thick, my shame too deep. So, I understand why, when I encourage clients to love themselves like God does, they pushback with exasperated sighs, clenched jaws, and many reasons they cannot or should not.... Love... them... selves.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI get it; I really do. I've flailed about in that undercurrent of strangely stubborn, paradoxical pride most of my life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you find yourself floundering there too, I'd like to throw you a life preserver.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStenciled across the top is the word, \\\"surrender.\\\" Slip it over your head and stop fighting the undertow. Take a deep breath and be gentle with yourself.  You'll be amazed how quickly you reach the shore.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EI encourage you to pursue your purpose if you've been putting it off.  Knowing why you are here will dramatically change your life.

For fine hair, opt for a light, volumizing product to refresh or hold the air-dried style. Naturally straight hair will benefit from a good shine spray to make roughed up morning hair look smooth. If you have thick and wavy hair, spritz leave-in styling product on the hair and scrunch, or apply the product in the waves with your hands to get rid of frizz. And don't forget a smoothing sealant is the secret to styling coarse and curly hair. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T14:52:44-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/air-drying-hair-right-way_n_7224142.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/air-drying-hair-right-way_n_7224142.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 18:52:44 UTC +00:00], ["title", "You're Air-Drying Your Hair All Wrong"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:04:58 UTC +00:00]]

It not only diminishes all of the good parenting I do, but it's just not true. I am not a bad parent, but I am far from a perfect parent. Some days, on the really, really hard days like we had recently, I didn't think I knew how to parent at all. Having young kids is tough, but usually the whining, crying, food throwing, and messes quickly transition to giggles, hugs, and goofy toddler behavior. The days can drag on, but happy hour is always right around the corner and bedtime is the light at the end of the tunnel.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430846937-3831378-Amber1.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430846937-3831378-Amber1.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430846937-3831378-Amber1-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"398\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe other day, I saw no light. From sunrise to sundown, the day was a mess. I was moody, my partner had very little patience, and each of our kids seemed to want nothing more than to stick to their individual agendas. And they wanted to do so with our undivided attention. The math doesn't add up on these days. Three kids needing mama's full focus at once will never get it, even when there are two mamas in the house.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut I don't know if even our attention would have helped. Our oldest was endlessly defiant, one of our twins was especially clingy and seemed to cry more than not, and our other twin wanted nothing more than to do what his big sister was doing, even if his safety was at risk. My partner and I could not get the bare minimum tasks accomplished, and we threw our hands up to doing anything other than surviving the day.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut then they were all asleep. A day's worth of clean up, laundry, and next-day prep needed to be done. Even while doing chores, it is time my partner and I finally have to carry on a conversation without interruption or clipped answers. Not true after that tough day. In our own way we tried to unwind but did so quietly. Her nerves were still frayed and her mood was still edgy. My ears still pounded from the onslaught of crying and screaming they endured. My body ached from being tense all day. Sometimes the silence was broken when we asked the other questions like, what should I have done in that situation? How should I have handled that differently? How could I have been better in that moment? Why did they all seem so unhappy today?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe didn't have the answers. If we had known, maybe our day would have been better. Some days are just a test of wills and questionable situations. And this day of parenting was one of them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYet, when I finally made my way to bed, I stopped to peek on the kids like I always do. With some humor, but all honesty, they really are perfectly beautiful when they are asleep. But that night I felt a pang of guilt with my usual burst of love for them. I wondered what they were dreaming about. After a day that felt miserable and endless to their mamas, I hoped they were not recalling the number of times we said no, enough, or stop. I hoped they weren't hearing our voices be too gruff. I hoped they were not longing for more cuddles and smiles after a day that had few.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey probably were not. They were probably thinking about what my partner and I eventually reminisced about well past a reasonable bedtime, even by parents' standards.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt took until almost 1:00 a.m. to remember the look on Ryan's face as he wore his big sister's bike helmet and ran as fast as he could across the yard to show off his new fashion item. It took hours after they were all asleep to remember that Eva hit a Wiffle ball over and over again while I pitched to her. And it took too long to remember that Ben sweetly threw the tennis ball for our dog, only to stop to squeal when the neighbor dog stuck his nose through our picket fence posts.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430846982-6701209-Amber2.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430846982-6701209-Amber2.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430846982-6701209-Amber2-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"427\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI hoped they were dreaming of these things and not the frustrated looks on our faces while we negotiated bedtime routines.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI hope they dream feeling happy and secure. I hope they can feel the strength of my love for them even in their dreams. And even on days when it is hard for their mamas to see the good, I hope it is all they see. At the end of each day, I know I am not a perfect parent and will never have all of the answers. But if I know my kids feel loved, even during the rough days, I will try to fall asleep each night with the best parts of each day in my mind. The best parts of their days don't make me the best parent; they keep me motivated to start each day with good parenting and give me the strength to parent better during the times when my best is mediocre.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EAmber Leventry is a writer for \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thenextfamily.com/2015/05/stuffed-animals-become-a-boys-kids/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EThe Next Family \\u003C/a\\u003Eand lives in Vermont with her wife and kids. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nArticles You Might Like: \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thenextfamily.com/2015/04/kids-the-facts-of-life-for-kids-with-lgbt-parents/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EWatch This Adorable Girl Explain How Her Two Moms Had a Baby\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thenextfamily.com/2015/05/my-daughter-is-a-hugger/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EWhy Do I Try To Curb My Daughter's Affections? \\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thenextfamily.com/2015/05/stuffed-animals-become-a-boys-kids/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EWhen The Stuffed Animals Get More Time-Outs Then My Kid\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T14:49:10-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-next-family/i-hope-my-children-feel-loved-even-on-my-toughest-parenting-days_b_7215032.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-next-family/i-hope-my-children-feel-loved-even-on-my-toughest-parenting-days_b_7215032.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 18:49:10 UTC +00:00], ["title", "I Hope My Children Feel Loved Even On My Toughest Parenting Days"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:04:58 UTC +00:00]]

I've been a vegetarian for most of my life, with a preference for greens and a strong aversion to burgers, steak, and anything involving meat.

'\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen I went to a dim sum restaurant, and with a steaming hot tin of dumplings on the table before me, I was tempted.

I felt like I'd just entered a culinary brothel of exquisite delights as my Chinese fiancé took my hand and led me into a crowded dining room of red lacquered walls, ladies pushing dim sum carts around dishing out tin after tin, tables spread and toppled with assorted tins both empty and full, diners eating, adorably fat babies squealing, mothers spooning their mouths full and wiping chubby little faces, large round tables full of people -- families, friends, couples -- all eating a feast of dumplings. Among the tins of gelatinous chicken feet, cha siu bao and endless pots of tea were those heavenly little mouthfuls of soup dumplings. I could not control my growing curiosity and hunger.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOnce I went raw vegan for nearly a year until I wanted a cheese omelette. I gave in to the craving because I just cannot live without eggs and cheese. After that indulgence, I attempted to be spartan and healthy by eating a macrobiotic diet, following a wholesome balancing act of yin and yang foods, consuming mostly seasonal vegetables, sea veggies, legumes and whole grains. But a month into that I felt completely macro-\\u003Cem\\u003Epsychotic\\u003C/em\\u003E, drooling for something more toothsome. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo I've come to the realization that I am someone who lives to eat, and abstaining from gourmand pleasures makes me edgy and hungry. Why live in such sensory denial? I want and need cheese, eggs, cream and butter with my vegetables. Though I've had my moments with what to eat, how to eat it and such, I was fairly content with my vegetarian ways much like being in a long marriage... \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n...until I had a taste of a pork dumpling.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWith my chopsticks poised to eat dumplings from steamer baskets, I have gone beyond my vegetable garden deep into the banquet halls of dim sum delights. How can I deny the come hither dimples of steaming xiao long bao soup dumplings? I admit I'm smitten, taken, and lustful. There is no going back. But now I've betrayed some unspoken vegetarian promise when I find meaty bites of pork succulent. I contemplate how this unlikely dumpling affair began.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1430977525-8528239-thedumplingaffairxiaolongbao.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-07-1430977525-8528239-thedumplingaffairxiaolongbao.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1430977525-8528239-thedumplingaffairxiaolongbao-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"379\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy vegetarian virginity is now lost after succumbing to this carnivorous desire, as I've gnawed on crispy fried pig ears, inhaled a lamb burger on brioche, eaten parts of a rabbit, slurped down snake soup, plunged my knife into elk tenderloin in brandied cherries, and eaten bacon cheddar buttermilk biscuits with immense pleasure. I have no shame. Ah, but for the love of dumplings. I want those bad boys of porcine pleasure made into pretty bite-sized bundles, brought to the table steaming hot in their stacking baskets. I want them and can't help it. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSince then, I've eaten Lobster Yi Mein with abandon, not bothering with chopsticks after inhaling the noodles, employing my dexterity to dig out the luscious flesh from its shell with my fingers.

The surprising gush held within the pocket of dumpling dripped down my chin, and my eyes sparkled with pleasure. So I ate up these marvelous little treasures with eager grasps of my chopsticks, wielding a soup spoon, adding fresh ginger slivers, vinegar, and chili mixed a quick dash of soy sauce. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf I had first eaten meat inside a dumpling skin as a little girl then maybe I would have liked it more.

It's like that saying, however awful it sounds, \\\"be a lady in the parlor but a whore in the bedroom.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe pork dumpling is completely separate from all other meat forms in my experience. There is poetry in the swirl of folds like closed flower petals. Its pleasing plumpness is accentuated by the wrapper skin holding a juicy nugget of meat within. The pink coil of the shrimp on top of shumai is utter foreplay to my mouth, teasing my tongue until I slowly bite into the unctuous pork, and the pillowy mouthful of the dumpling oozes its glorious juices.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431020582-3190677-Sunday_ChineseDumplings.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-07-1431020582-3190677-Sunday_ChineseDumplings.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431020582-3190677-Sunday_ChineseDumplings-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"354\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe next time you consider yourself vegan, vegetarian, carnivore or omnivore, just close your eyes and open your mouth to the gourmet pleasures of the dumpling, digging your chopsticks right in without question. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T14:48:24-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-kordan/the-dumpling-affair_b_7229082.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-kordan/the-dumpling-affair_b_7229082.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 18:48:24 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Dumpling Affair"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:04:58 UTC +00:00]]

She still dreams of her own education. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSudanese women like Betty and Joyce were denied an education due to constant war, dislocation, and the dominance of ideology and norms that discouraged efforts to educate women.

Yet there is a growing body of evidence on the benefits of educating young women and girls. Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen was among the first to link women's education to reduced child mortality and fertility rates.

The current conflict, if Rwanda and South Sudan are any example, suggests that women and girls are at heightened risk, not only for increased gender-based violence, but also for losing their hard fought educational gains and, ultimately, a pathway to a better life. It is a risk that impacts all of society.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe have learned that global, multilateral efforts in the region are weak-kneed and often ineffective. Regional leaders should prepare to intervene; the African Union should commit to the world that Burundi's presidential elections will not become a prelude to another civil war, or genocide. Swift action is needed in Burundi before it's too late for the tens of thousands of women like Betty Sandy Moses, whose education and ability to contribute to her country was stopped by war. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EKaren Sherman is the Executive Director of the Akilah Institute for Women and a Senior Associate on Women's Economic Empowerment at the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.

The initial reaction was a lot of hand-wringing. During the preceding two decades, Americans learned the importance of math and science, both in research and in public life, but Sputnik showed we had lost our competitive edge. Life magazine ran a cover story comparing a studious Moscow high school student with a prom-infatuated American teenager. Some pundits scolded schools for emphasizing the basics too much while others suggested they were focused on too little. We were perplexed; we were frightened; we were angry.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut after less than a year, our nation stopped focusing on our weaknesses and instead focused on our strengths. In August 1958, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, which provided scholarships and fellowships to prospective mathematicians and scientists. Math and science teachers were specially favored in that program. The National Science Foundation ran intensive summer workshops for teachers that brought together the best, immersed them in math or science for weeks at a time and fostered a passion for their subject. These teachers inspired their students and one another. These were my teachers in the early 1960s in chemistry, physics and mathematics, and they changed my life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the decade that followed, our country continued to build on our strengths, culminating in the moon landing in 1969 -- an event celebrated by the entire world. The public's imagination was ignited by the possibilities math and science offered. We had high aspirations and a long-term vision for scientific progress. We increased the number of mathematicians and scientists many-fold during the 1960s, leaving a legacy of inspired teachers and a generation of young people who were turned on by math and science. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat were the lessons of Sputnik for education? Two are obvious.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFirst, while it's important to acknowledge education's shortcomings, hand-wringing doesn't solve problems. Solutions come by focusing on strength rather than dwelling on weakness. For example, some teachers are truly outstanding in the classroom. Find out why and then use them as models. And above all, keep them teaching!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSecond, of all the activities we undertook in the decade following Sputnik -- new curricula, new textbooks, new technology - our investment in teachers had the most lasting effect. Those educators influenced their students long after the new math had disappeared, the textbooks were pulped and the technology was superseded by handheld calculators.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe have forgotten these lessons in the past 30 years. We now focus on what is going wrong - failing schools, weak teachers, struggling students. We expend most of our effort on rooting out bad teachers or bad schools. We fret endlessly about curriculum, assessments and technology, seeking some magic to improve achievement. We replace bold aspirations, like creativity and curiosity, with exceedingly modest ones, like higher test scores. Because the public hears only about education's failures, confidence in education is at an all-time low, down by more than half since the early 1970s. Teachers are demoralized and interest in the profession is plummeting. Some of our best teachers are just walking away. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe can change this, and the lessons of Sputnik tell us where to begin -- by focusing on the exceptional teachers already in our classrooms.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMaster Teacher programs select outstanding math and science teachers, where \\\"outstanding\\\" is carefully defined -- teachers who know their subject, deeply and appropriately, who know the craft of teaching and who know their students and their needs. Holding teachers accountable for these things is meaningful accountability. Master teachers come together in lively communities of scholars, with much of the activity driven by the teachers themselves. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey create and run workshops on math, science or teaching itself--with subjects ranging from Common Core, 3D printing and AP statistics to the biochemical deconstruction of sandwiches, the chemistry of art and neurological disorders in students. These programs provide educators with opportunities to learn about recent developments in their fields, compare notes and talk about policy. In short, they do what accomplished professionals do in any field. And they are given additional compensation for this work as recognition for their professional efforts and accomplishment. Above all, they receive respect.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSuch programs already exist -- I head one and there are others around the country, including one recently created by New York State -- but they are too few and too scattered. We need more, in every state.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAfter thirty years of wringing our hands, we ought to realize by now that we are not making things better. Instead, we are losing our most inspiring teachers and failing to bring in new ones. We need to make teaching an attractive profession if we want to get better.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThat's what we learned from Sputnik. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T14:41:29-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-ewing2/what-sputnik-taught-us_b_7226546.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-ewing2/what-sputnik-taught-us_b_7226546.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 18:41:29 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What Sputnik Taught Us"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:04:58 UTC +00:00]]

Gleiber, M.D.\",\"description\":\"Juices cleanses are a trendy weight-loss method. Proponents of juice cleanses claim you will lose weight and remove toxins from your body. Is it really healthy to only have liquids for as long as a week?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you don't get enough fruits and vegetables in your diet, juicing may help in that area. In most cases, a 3 to 5 day juice cleanse may not hurt you, but it won't necessarily help your overall health very much either. Consider these 4 facts before deciding whether a juice cleanse is right for you.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n1. \\u003Cstrong\\u003EWe don't really need a \\\"cleanse\\\" to remove toxins from our bodies.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nProponents of juicing often claim that these \\\"cleanses\\\" will remove toxins from the body. However, we already have a \\\"cleansing\\\" mechanism in our bodies -- the liver, kidneys and intestines. The job of these \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/detox-diets/faq-20058040\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eorgans\\u003C/a\\u003E is to filter out all of bad stuff from the things we ingest. If the \\\"detox\\\" part of the juice cleanse was a main selling point for you, you should probably skip it. No amount of juice is going to undo that double cheeseburger you ate last week. If you slipped up on your diet and overindulged, you just have to move forward and try to do better with your diet. Remember, being healthy is a lifestyle, not a week-long thing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n2. \\u003Cstrong\\u003EYou could be missing out on important nutrients if you only have juice.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFruits and vegetables in their whole state contain fiber, which helps to keep you full and aids in the digestive process. However, most juices remove the pulp and skins from fruits and vegetables, so you lose out on all of those nutrients. If you really want to \\\"juice,\\\" it might be better to blend your fruits and vegetables into a smoothie so you can keep the skin and pulp. You also need to keep in mind that if you're only having juice during your cleanse, you won't be getting any healthy fats or proteins, which your body needs to build healthy tissues. Depriving your body of these nutrients for several days isn't going to do you any good.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n3. \\u003Cstrong\\u003EAny weight you lose will be water weight.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you only have juices for several days, you probably will lose weight because you are depriving yourself of lots of things; you are more or less starving yourself. The problem is, as soon as you resume your regular diet, you'll gain all of that weight back. This deprivation-type of dieting can also cause dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and irritability. Is all of that really worth it just to drop a few pounds for a couple of days?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n4. \\u003Cstrong\\u003EJuicing can be harmful to people with certain health conditions.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlthough we think of fruits as healthy, they can contain a lot of sugar. This often translates into a high amount of sugar in juices, which can be problematic for people with diabetes. All of that extra sugar could cause the blood-sugar to skyrocket. Juicing can also be harmful to those with kidney disease; too much potassium can build up in the blood, causing symptoms like muscle weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, and chest pain. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should also avoid juice fasts. Juices do have high levels of antioxidants, but that combined with a lack of protein can be harmful to those undergoing chemotherapy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThe purpose of this article isn't to discourage you from avoiding juicing altogether. If juices are the only way you get the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables in a day, then it's worth incorporating into your diet. Depriving yourself of certain nutrients just isn't worth it to drop a little weight. If you really want to make a difference in your health, think of food as part of your lifestyle, rather than a diet.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003ETo learn more tips on your path to a healthier lifestyle, visit our \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://michaelgleibermd.com/news/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eblog\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJoin the conversation on \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gleibermd\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ETwitter\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/GleiberSpineMD\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EFacebook\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T15:02:15-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-a-gleiber-md/starting-a-juice-cleanse-4-things-you-need-to-know_b_7215796.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-a-gleiber-md/starting-a-juice-cleanse-4-things-you-need-to-know_b_7215796.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:02:15 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Starting a Juice Cleanse? 4 Things You Need to Know"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:12:55 UTC +00:00]]

Also on hand were playing cards stamped with his initials, and poker chips. During the ceremony, U2's Bono sang \\\"One,\\\" the Irish rock band's anthem to love and support...\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany guests entered through side and back doors after driving into a cordoned-off area behind the hall. Some, such as Hewlett Packard Chief Executive Meg Whitman, walked up the steps and through the main entrance.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany began offering personal tributes to Goldberg on social media on Saturday, including Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. Sandberg, however, remained silent until Tuesday morning, when she responded to a public note by President Barack Obama.\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLet me say that I extend my condolences to the family, even though I do not know them and never will, nor any of the people they associate with.  The ceremony was private, sequestered off -- for the afternoon that portion of Stanford was given over to this event.  I have absolutely no criticism of that, except for the fact that classes were cancelled and faculty and students left to their own devices to make up for that.  I mention this only as part of a contrast I want to draw out, and the point I want to make goes far beyond Stanford, Facebook, and the President of the United States.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nConsider the difference between the event I just mentioned and another, which took place on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day this year, when dozens of Stanford students shut down the San Mateo Bridge for an hour.  On January 19, the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stanford-students-arrested-protests-20150119-story.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ELos Angeles Times\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003C/a\\u003E reported that:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003EThe group identified itself as Silicon Shutdown, a collective of Stanford students organizing against police brutality and oppression, according to its website and Twitter account. At one point, protesters unrolled a large Palestinian flag on the bridge.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThey held up traffic on the westbound side for 28 minutes, a time chosen to symbolize that \\\"every 28 hours, a black person is killed by law enforcement or vigilantes,\\\" according to a press release posted on Silicon Shutdown's website.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"We chose to inconvenience the weekend commute because the status quo is deadly to the black and brown peoples of this country and can no longer be tolerated,\\\" participant Maria Diaz, a member of Stanford's class of 2017, said in a publicly posted statement.\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAngry comments posted on the LAT website equated this act with acts of terrorism; people scolded \\\"pampered Stanford students\\\" for harassing people trying to get to their jobs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNow think of the assumptions that are built into both these events and public reaction to them.  For the Goldberg memorial, no question: disrupt campus life as much as is necessary to honor the man.  And collect the luminaries in Silicon Valley, not to mention Bono, so they can properly mourn their collective loss.  At base, this is all part of normal Silicon Valley, and elite American, life.  Stanford was transformed into a staging ground for a ritual that is repeated over and over and over again -- recognizing the value of entrepreneurship, innovation, \\\"disruption\\\" in the capitalist mode, and just being a good member of that elite group. The well-known fact that corporate boardrooms in the Valley are notorious for their lack of minorities, let alone blacks, would be a rude thing to mention in the midst of all the ceremony, and I have no desire to do so.  Except, again, by way of drawing an important, and telling, contrast.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe students who disrupted, for an hour, the peaceful commute to work in Silicon Valley, were arrested, jailed, charged.  For what?  For calling attention to another scene of mourning and grief and death -- and a multitude of such scenes which are repeated over and over again in black and brown communities.  The university did nothing to support the students -- but why should it? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd yet there is a case to be made that the students actually, as they intended, performed an educational service.  How else would these people -- who, by and large normally would never be in contact with poor people of color -- have any sense, no matter how fleeting, of the disruption to \\\"daily life\\\" the silenced and oppress face every single day?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs a society, we have accepted the disruptions to life the very privileged and the very powerful visit upon us.  And I am not talking only about ceremonies like the one that took place at Stanford.  At this point, I want to leave that event in the distance and address the wider point.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI am not bitter about the brief interruption to Stanford life.  At base I am more concerned about the disparity of privilege, rights, and sanctioned behaviors that we tolerate and are told to get used to.  I have an idea -- let Stanford fund a #BlackLivesMatter memorial at the same location as the Goldberg memorial.  And let it not be a private ceremony: let us open our doors to the community. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T15:02:08-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-palumboliu/ceo-lives-matter-what-about-others_b_7233282.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-palumboliu/ceo-lives-matter-what-about-others_b_7233282.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:02:08 UTC +00:00], ["title", "#CEOLivesMatter -- What About Others?"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:12:55 UTC +00:00]]

According to survey results from \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ERomance Writers of America\\u003C/a\\u003E, 84 percent of romance readers are women and 16 percent are men -- up from 9 percent a few years ago. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile 70% of romance readers discover the genre between the ages of 11 and 18, most romance readers tend to be older (the average age range is from 30 and 54 years-old.) She's also likely to be coupled up and has an average income of $55,000 per year. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe romance industry is large -- more than half of the mass market paperbacks sold in the U.S. are romance -- and it's readership is vast as well. So for every desperate housewife, there's a happily harried wife and/or mom taking a break with a romance novel. For every lonely spinster, there's an unapologetic single woman. And for every sorority sister, there's a proud geek girl who loves romance novels.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u0026nbsp; \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMYTH: The address of the romance reader: Fly over state, USA\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFACT: \\u003C/strong\\u003EThere is a grain of truth in this one. In the United States, romance readers are most highly represented in the south, followed by the midwest.

The non-romance readers I surveyed thought romance readers were less likely to have an advance degree than romance readers reported having attained. But the idea that women's fiction was frivolous and the readers were foolish goes way back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when the novel was gaining popularity and women were gaining literacy. General impressions of women's intelligence were hardly flattering, probably because no one thought to give girls an education. This is just an old, leftover association that is hardly relevant these days -- isn't stupid to keep perpetuating it?  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430840995-8423216-smartwomen.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430840995-8423216-smartwomen.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430840995-8423216-smartwomen-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"380\\\" height=\\\"266\\\" align=\\\"center\\\"/\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMYTH: Romance readers lack romance in real life. \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFACT:\\u003C/strong\\u003E \\\"I don't think people assume that people who read mystery novels are thwarted detectives,\\\"Esi Sogah, a senior editor at Kensington books, told me. \\\"But there's this idea that people who like romances don't actually have romance in their lives.\\\" Get some candles, soft music, wine, flowers, chocolate and a hunk of a man immediately.

And if someone doesn't have a relationship that looks like the ones she reads about in romance novels -- where she is cherished, pleasured and respected -- and that gets her thinking about making some changes, is that so bad?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u0026nbsp; \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMYTH: Romance readers wear ugly sweaters\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFACT:\\u003C/strong\\u003E So does Mr. Darcy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u0026nbsp; \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430839981-7757695-darcy.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430839981-7757695-darcy.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430839981-7757695-darcy-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMYTH: Romance readers are stay at home mothers and housewives, idling away the hours by reading trashy \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.dangerousbooksforgirls.com/fabio/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EFabio books\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFACT:\\u003C/strong\\u003E Well this is a fraught subject. Raising a family and keeping a house in order is a tough job and someone has to do it.

I remember clearly that instinctive feeling I got of being in front of something that had a lot more raw talent, heart and humor than half the other things I had seen in that show, and perhaps elsewhere, in a long time.  Kawai's colorful and dynamic pieces have evolved but they continue to engage and move me while her career has calmly and steadily been on the rise.  Ever since that Deitch exhibit, her work has been included in a variety of solo and group shows around the world including the Institute of Contemporary Art ICA Boston, The Watarium Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, P.S. 1 MOMA Contemporary Art Center in New York City, The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, The Watermill Center in New York and The Children's Museum of Art in New York City.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956386-1580308-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai33.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430956386-1580308-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai33.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956386-1580308-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai33-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo when I heard from \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ericfirestonegallery.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EEric Firestone\\u003C/a\\u003E that Kawai was working on a special solo-booth installation to be unveiled at \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.newartdealers.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ENADA Art Fair\\u003C/a\\u003E next Thursday, May 14th, I could not resist the urge to go and see everything before the work came to be installed in New York City. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956056-5741908-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai17.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430956056-5741908-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai17.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956056-5741908-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai17-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"429\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the same tradition of great painters who settled in the Hamptons during the winter months to work without interruption and take advantage of the large spaces and one of the most beautiful lights of the Northeast (Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Robert Motherwell are just a few who come to mind), Kawai and her husband, photographer Justin Waldron, set camp in a modernist-style home and adjacent studio in East Hampton.  Kawai's studio space allowed her to produce as many pieces as she wanted in as many different formats and sizes as she would need (including large, medium and small canvases along with super cool furniture pieces). \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956241-8308256-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai22.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430956241-8308256-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai22.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956241-8308256-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai22-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile admiring the explosion of saturated colors, mostly primary but ranging from deep black to hot pink, it dawned on me that Kawai's work also fits the description of a contemporary expressionist.  She's constantly exploring the subject matter of the objects that surround her day-to-day life and the way she sees them, adding a touch of humor with shapes, words or hashtags.  There is a lot of her internal world that she gives to us spectators, but it is ultimately the unexpected that we find in her work that keeps us guessing and on our toes.  For example: one of the pieces in the studio is a large yellow canvas depicting several animals that look like crocodiles or iguanas, but Kawai aptly points out that the green creatures are dinosaurs taken from video games.  When I look again, some of the characters on the canvas remind me of the days when I incessantly played Pac-Man, which must have also been on Kawai's radar since Atari is a Japanese company and we are both from the same generation. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956137-9436565-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai18.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430956137-9436565-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai18.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430956137-9436565-MariaBrito_MisakiKawai18-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"320\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe caricaturesque nature of her work is so intertwined with the aesthetics and graphics that are commonplace in modern Japan - where cartoons are used as graphics for so many products, retail spaces, signage and more.  She not only agrees but emphasizes that in her hometown of Osaka, which is known for being the Japanese capital of comedy, that even when bad things happen in life, people will try to make joke out of it.  And that seems to be exactly Misaki Kawai's philosophy of life and perspective on her surroundings.  I left inspired and uplifted, finding optimism in everything I saw that day and trying, even if for a day or two, to emulate Kawai's vantage point in life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EMisaki Kawai \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNADA NYC\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nPier 36 \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEric Firestone Gallery\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBooth 4.02 \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMay 14 - 17, 2015 \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T15:44:01-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-gabriela-brito/misaki-kawais-soulful-neo_b_7227948.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-gabriela-brito/misaki-kawais-soulful-neo_b_7227948.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 19:44:01 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Misaki Kawai's Soulful Neo Expressionism"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 20:33:25 UTC +00:00]]

When I was 16, en route to school, a rebel army abducted me and, to make a dark story short, forced me to do terrible things against my will, and very much against my nature. I was lucky to escape with my life.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWith northern Uganda in chaos, my family was not to be found. I made my way to the capital city Kampala, where an uncle I had never met was said to live. I found him living with two wives and four children in a two-room house in the slum known as Nguru. They found room for me, and offered a mat on the floor and I began to earn money to resume my education.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430855858-2715180-ScreenShot20150504at2.32.16PM.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430855858-2715180-ScreenShot20150504at2.32.16PM.png\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430855858-2715180-ScreenShot20150504at2.32.16PM-thumb.png\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"355\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCulture is an important part of human development. Our values are embedded in our culture. So it's no wonder I found solace and healing through art. I practiced and studied the arts in high school, then college, ultimately earning a degree in performing arts. This started a career that has allowed me to see the world. Whenever I feel a darkness creep into my soul, I sing, dance and play music on the adungu, a traditional hand-held harp of northern Uganda. It always works, the darkness recedes. Art is my detox.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTen years after my own bitter experience, just as my career started to take off, my younger brother Godfrey, a special person to me, was abducted and killed by Joseph Kony's infamous Lord's Resistance Army.

Our culture is very much based in place, each year we celebrate our birthdays at the place where we have buried our umbilical cord. When we were forcibly moved from our homes, this hurt our souls.

To find that I can still communicate through him, and to him in this play, has been important to me. I could have chosen to write a song, or an essay, I suppose. But theatre has a broad reach and endless life. The basic elements of theatre are universal: poetry, motion, emotion, visual arts and music. Anyone can relate to these things, even if you are blind or deaf, you will appreciate theatre.
