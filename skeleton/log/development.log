The bars, among other things, are too high in saturated fat to qualify.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow the lawsuits are rolling in. In California,\\u003Cem\\u003E \\u003C/em\\u003Ethree separate class action suits have been filed against the company, all within 10 days of the letter\\u0026#8217;s publication, all making the same basic argument: KIND\\u0026#8217;s misleading marketing deceives consumers into buying food that isn\\u0026#8217;t healthy, at least by FDA standards. None allege that the bars physically harmed them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;We\\u0026#8217;ve really crossed a bridge,\\u0026#8221; says Ted Craig, a consumer class action attorney who specializing in suits like these. \\u0026#8220;There\\u0026#8217;s a long history of products liability where products are harmful or unhealthy,\\u0026#8221; he says. Suing for a product that misleads but isn\\u0026#8217;t harmful is \\u0026#8220;going to the next level.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe lawsuits are undoubtedly driven by lawyers, not consumers, adds Craig. If the plaintiffs prevail, which is not guaranteed, even with the FDA warning letter, there is still a question about how they will be compensated. Say consumers get back the full dollar amount of their KIND bar purchases—something Craig says is unlikely since the bars still have \\u003Cem\\u003Esome \\u003C/em\\u003Evalue—that still only amounts to about $2/bar.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe lawyers litigating the case, however, will get a percentage of the total amount rewarded to everyone—a much, much higher amount than what any individual consumer will take home. The plaintiffs are filing suit \\u0026#8220;solely for purposes of recovering money damages and not in the name of protecting consumers,\\u0026#8221; says Craig. That explains why there are \\u003Cem\\u003Ethree\\u003C/em\\u003E class action lawsuits, all filed within one week of each other, rather than one. \\u0026#8220;Three different groups of lawyers [are] trying to be the one that represents the class,\\u0026#8221; Craig says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EKIND makes for a good target: It\\u0026#8217;s a relatively small player in the $2.8 billion energy and nutrition bar market (it sold roughly $336 million in KIND bars last year, according to Euromonitor) that doesn\\u0026#8217;t have the legal or financial might that a dominant player like Kellogg would.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat\\u0026#8217;s worse, these lawyers are building on an FDA judgment that seems out of proportion. \\u0026#8220;Technically, the FDA is correct that KIND didn\\u0026#8217;t comply [with requirements for \\u0026#8216;healthy\\u0026#8217;], specifically with regards to fat content,\\u0026#8221; says Sherzod Abdukadirov, a research fellow at George Mason University public policy think tank the Mercatus Center. But when it comes to saturated fat, he says, the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303678404579533760760481486\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Escience is not settled\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u0026#8220;The FDA does have discretion about which companies to go after,\\u0026#8221; he says, adding that sending the letter to KIND was a \\u0026#8220;heavy-handed tactic.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;I think the FDA is being overly zealous,\\u0026#8221; says Craig.

Program. It is an incredibly important program for the health and well-being of economically vulnerable Americans. Considered to be the nation’s first line of defense against hunger, SNAP delivers timely and targeted food assistance to people faced with hard times.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, SNAP\\u0026#8217;s strengths are many—reducing hunger and poverty, improving nutrition and health—but its biggest weakness is its low benefit level. Quite simply, it isn’t enough to get people through the month, let alone allow them to purchase healthy food for that time. Typically, healthier foods like fresh produce cost more. And when people have few funds dedicated to groceries, they often find their dollars go further when purchasing calories rather than nutrients.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESNAP benefits are too low because they are based \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://frac.org/pdf/thrifty_food_plan_2012.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eon an outdated plan\\u003C/a\\u003E that was created for emergency diets. But this could be fixed. Congress could update this calculation and give people more adequate benefits.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere is recent evidence of the positive impact of higher benefits. In 2009, at the height of economic recession in the United States, SNAP benefits were temporarily increased by 13.6% as part of the stimulus provisions included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Research on the ARRA boost and benefit adequacy showed improved well-being and health.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor example:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/227714/foodsecuritysnap_1_.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EA 2011 report\\u003C/a\\u003E by the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service looked at data from late 2008 (before passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) to late 2009 (post-ARRA) and found that food insecurity decreased among low-income households in that time.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/upload/resource/snapincrease_brief_oct11.pdf?PHPSESSID=0e24026e192ed7d1d511b1638ac8338d\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EA different 2011 report,\\u003C/a\\u003E this one from Children’s HealthWatch, meanwhile found a measurable impact on children’s health. Two years after the ARRA increase went into effect, children in families receiving SNAP were more likely to be classified as “well” (meaning they were in good health and developing normally) than young children whose families were eligible for but did not receive SNAP.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnfortunately, this benefit increase was phased out, and families again are left with benefits that are too low.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt can be hard for people with enough food to eat to understand what it feels like to not have a consistent source of nutritious meals. But it is for precisely this reason that the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://frac.org/initiatives/snapfood-stamp-challenges/\\\"\\u003ESNAP Challenge\\u003C/a\\u003E exists: participants spend one week eating on $29, and document their purchases and meals, to show others what it\\u0026#8217;s like.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOf course, the challenge does not come close to the experiences of low-income families struggling week after week and month after month, but it does give a glimpse of what it means to live on such a limited budget—to see the choices that one must make in navigating the grocery store and trying to purchase enough food to last the week.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ESNAP’s biggest weakness is its low benefit level.

Awareness that millions of Americans—one in six, according to the non-profit Food research and Action Center\\u0026#8217;s latest \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://frac.org/how-hungry-is-america/\\\"\\u003Efood hardship report\\u003C/a\\u003E—struggle to afford enough food. Awareness that there is a solution and that benefits should be increased. Awareness that in the midst of this conversation, Congress is considering harming people further through cuts to SNAP that would lower benefits. This is precisely the wrong direction.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is up to us to keep the conversation on track by pointing out the inadequacy of benefits and by urging Congress to look at ways to end hunger, rather than doubling down on the problem. Doing this is much easier that we think. People can add their voice to a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://org2.salsalabs.com/o/5118/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=19755\\\"\\u003Epetition\\u003C/a\\u003E in support of SNAP, they can contact their members of Congress, and they can share these facts to urge even more people to speak out on behalf of this work.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EFor more information on the Food Stamp Challenge, check out \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://frac.org/initiatives/snapfood-stamp-challenges/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EFRAC\\u0026#8217;s website here\\u003C/a\\u003E.

While it may seem somewhat obvious, in my experience I find that the best approach is also the most simple: fairness and equal opportunity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe aim of any interview is to help a hiring manager evaluate whether or not the person being interviewed is the best fit for the available position, and also for the candidate to decide if the job and company in question is right for them. Unfortunately, in my experience, achieving the ideal level of fairness in this process is quite difficult. And often times, differences in practice ultimately disadvantage the candidate when an interviewer or corporation has a predisposed bias.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor example, I have been asked dozens of times what my average day looks like—a not so subtle nod to the fact that the person interviewing me knows I have a son. Implicit in that question are several others: \\u003Cem\\u003E“What time would I get to the office? What time do I need to leave?”\\u003C/em\\u003E Meanwhile, my male counterparts are never asked those types of questions, despite being parents themselves.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EIf a question is inappropriate to ask a man in an interview, then it is inappropriate to ask a woman. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough François-Henri might argue differently, there should really be no difference in the questions that a woman is asked versus the questions a man is asked during an interview. If a question is inappropriate to ask a man, then it is inappropriate to ask a woman. Depending on the job, employers should generally not be searching for skill sets in men that they would not be searching for in women.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA more effective strategy involves taking the names off of resumes and replacing them with numbers. This really allows the employer or hiring manager to get rid of any of their inherent biases (and this goes not just for sex, but also ethnicity, etc.) and focus on a candidate’s qualifications.  This proved to be a very interesting, not to mention useful exercise, yielding stronger candidates during the interview rounds, while weeding out some of the eliminating bias through one step of the application process.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut what about that last, inevitably fraught step: salary? \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EStudies show us that \\u003C/a\\u003Eas a result on a variety of factors, women—both in the US and abroad—still \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/382772/to-fight-income-inequality-tell-your-friends-how-much-you-make/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Estruggle to achieve equal pay\\u003C/a\\u003E.

My personal experience, after many years as a professional woman, has taught me to feel comfortable asking for the salary I believe I’m worth. This shows an interviewer that you are confident in your self-worth. If they react to that distastefully (as long as you’re not asking to be an entry-level millionaire), it’s probably not a place you want to work anyways.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EMy personal experience, after many years as a professional woman, has taught me to feel comfortable asking for the salary I believe I’m worth. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’ve also learned to be bold in discussing my accomplishments instead of apologizing for them. I have witnessed so many times women explain why they “weren\\u0026#8217;t really running their team,” when in fact they were. It’s perfectly acceptable, even encouraged, to tout your accomplishments and be proud of them. The confidence I have found through my work—and my ability to promote that work to the world—is what allowed me to drive Sherpaa forward alongside my co-founder, Jay Parkinson. As an entrepreneur and the face of our company, I know that every day is essentially an interview with my customers, current and potential.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile it’s clear that a perfect, unbiased interview may only be achievable in a vacuum, continuing to talk openly about the problems women face—and the strategies that can bridge the gap—is the only way we’ll ever make significant changes. There is no right way to conduct an interview, no matter what side of the table you’re on. But there are several things employers and candidates can do in the meantime to ensure workplaces move toward more equal interview and hiring practices in the future.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=399584\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/399584/should-women-be-given-special-treatment-during-job-interviews/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T09:10:39-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=399584\",\"dc_creator\":\"Cheryl Swirnow\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/rtr30yfg.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Students wait for an interview during work readiness training at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/rtr30yfg.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/399584/should-women-be-given-special-treatment-during-job-interviews/"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 13:10:39 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Should women be given special treatment during job interviews?"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:00:30 UTC +00:00]]

These are processes, Jha argues, that countries and societies have taken decades to achieve. Nepal is leap-frogging in no time—and when you see it this way, you’d be slightly less contemptuous of Kathmandu’s acrimonious polity. These processes began after the royal massacre of 2001—14 years ago.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EPoints of conflict\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EConsider, in contrast, how India’s various conflicts, in Kashmir, the North East and the tribal belt, have been dragging on for decades, with New Delhi \\u0026#8220;managing\\u0026#8221; rather than seeking to resolve them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Nepali war years from 1996 to 2006 left 16,000 dead, 1,300 disappeared and thousands displaced. In a world full of conflict, these numbers appear small. Yet, a world full of conflict also needs to learn from the Nepali example of sorting out the changing nature of its society and politics through constitution-making, slowly but steadily. Bringing the Maoists to the table was no mean achievement, one that India came around to supporting.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs Nepal debates what kind of a society and country it wants to be, the churning has been throwing up some progressive trends. It is curious, for instance, why Nepal has almost no internet censorship, a claim no other South Asian country can make. Internet censorship, more than even press censorship, is a sign of how free a society is. It is curious why Nepal’s politicians don’t seek to muzzle online voices even though their politics is bitter to the point of being internecine. Blood is shed before every election.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis is not an isolated case of being comfortable with free speech and dissent. Nepal is also the only country in South Asia with no restrictions on community radio. Anybody can set up a local community radio station. News and politics are allowed. There were 263 operational community radio stations when the earthquake struck; 20 of them have been destroyed. Community radio is a powerful tool for bridging the information divide in poor societies like ours. Unfortunately, India is too afraid of radio, and does not give community radio licenses to anyone other than small NGOs and universities. India doesn’t even allow news on FM radio.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMinority freedoms\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENepal is the only country in South Asia where homosexuality is not criminalised. The Nepali Supreme Court did decriminalised it in 2008 and even asked the government to legislate in favour of equal rights to sexual minorities, which the constituent assembly is deliberating upon. When Nepal gets a new constitution, it may even legalise gay marriage. In 2008, Sunil Babu Pant became a member of the first constituent assembly (2008-2012), thus becoming the only openly gay politician in South Asia.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe first constituent assembly was described by the United Nations as having set a “gold standard on inclusion of minorities.” A third of its 601 members were women, Dalit representation was up from 0 to 49 in just a decade. The second constituent assembly, too, has such diversity that it has thirty political parties and two independents. The earthquake will perhaps bring some urgency to the constituent assembly, making its members find a middle ground between their differences.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Indian Constitution and the formative years of the Indian state were helped by Nehru, who had few political challengers. In Nepal’s case, the polity is bitterly fractured between a declining feudal order and an assertive subaltern politics. To this churning, the earthquake has come as a major setback. India and the world can only help Nepal. It is ultimately Nepal that will have to rebuild itself. While it does so, India would do well to learn a few lessons from Nepal. The most important of those, of course, is how to prepare for an earthquake.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThis post first appeared on \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://scroll.in/article/725188/what-india-can-learn-from-nepal\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EScroll.in\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/378484/there-is-hardly-anything-indian-about-the-indian-curry/ideas.india@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eideas\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/378484/there-is-hardly-anything-indian-about-the-indian-curry/ideas.india@qz.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E.\\u003Cem\\u003Eindia\\u003C/em\\u003E@\\u003Cem\\u003Eqz.com\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"edition-credit india\\\"\\u003EThis article is a part of Quartz India.

In most cases this would mean Libya. A complicating factor is the current split between the two governments that claim to represent the State of Libya.

In short, the situation is murky. After having repeatedly offered its cooperation to help fight the smuggling operations, the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/us-europe-migrants-libya-idUSKBN0NE0RL20150423\\\"\\u003ETripoli government has said it will not give consent to using force against people smugglers\\u003C/a\\u003E.

African countries’ failure to clamp down on people smugglers’ activities may constitute a violation of the \\u0026#8220;duty of vigilance\\u0026#8221; (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/116/10455.pdf\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EArmed Activities\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E para 246-250), but such a violation does not in itself authorize other States to respond with armed force.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFurther, if we concede that international humanitarian law applies, smugglers’ boats would be entitled to protection as civilian objects. The smugglers’ activities should not qualify as \\u0026#8220;piracy\\u0026#8221; under the UNCLOS Article 101. That would in any case only make them liable to seizure by force by any State on the high seas (Article 105). To argue that the provision allows to destroy their ships when docked in a harbour seems too much of a stretch.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe real problem isn\\u0026#8217;t the boats\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile there are legal avenues open for using force against African people smugglers, a wholly different question is whether this would actually contribute to solving the problem. The former head of operations of \\u003Cem\\u003EAtalanta\\u003C/em\\u003E has recently stated that to destroy smugglers’ boats would not be effective, as the boats used tend to be \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32428500\\\"\\u003Echeap and easy to replace\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn a broader perspective, it would help solve neither the underlying causes of migration, which include conflict and misrule in Africa, nor the causes of the EU’s attempts to restrict migration, which include its social and economic costs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe EU does seem to envisage the destruction of boats as \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/04/23-special-euco-statement/\\\"\\u003Eone element in a broader set of tools\\u003C/a\\u003E.

Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels estimates the price tag to be closer to $55 billion to $60 billion. \\u0026#8220;For that reason alone, it looks implausible,\\u0026#8221; he tells Quartz. Jeffries analysts note that would represent about two years of Microsoft\\u0026#8217;s free-cash flow.

There are only so many companies that could make such an acquisition, and Bartels says SAP and IBM are stretched too thin to shell out $50-plus billion. That leaves Oracle, which happens to be Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff\\u0026#8217;s old stomping grounds.

So far, Google Ventures, of which he is managing partner, has poured $2 billion into 300 of them, including the likes of Uber, the car hailing service; Slack, the office messaging system; Medium, the blogging platform; and a host of life-sciences and health companies.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECorporate venture capital funds have been around for years.

A conflict of interest implies wrongdoing, whereas competition is really healthy. I set up Google Ventures specifically to invest in things that might compete with Google. In all of the 300 investments, never once has Google tried to influence an investment. And when we set it up, Larry and Sergei don’t have a say. That was intentional. And I said, the first day Google tries to influence those things will be my last day here.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-399439\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  alignleft zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"399439\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F399232%2Fwhat-its-like-to-run-googles-2-billion-venture-capital-fund%2Fi%2F399439%2F\\u0026text=What+it%26%238217%3Bs+like+to+run+Google%26%238217%3Bs+%242+billion+venture+capital+fund\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F399232%2Fwhat-its-like-to-run-googles-2-billion-venture-capital-fund%2Fi%2F399439%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/maris2.jpg?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/maris2.jpg?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"Maris QZ\\\" title=\\\"Google Ventures\\u0026#8217; Bill Maris in the Quartz newsroom.\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003EGoogle Ventures\\u0026#8217; Bill Maris in the Quartz newsroom.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"inline-image-credit\\\"\\u003E(Jacob Templin/Quartz)\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe whole business has to be based on our interests being aligned with entrepreneurs.

That’s how we get measured, but there are many unintended consequences that Google benefits from. Hundreds of startup founders who have reason to talk to people at Google, build relationships.

Julia Ward Howe famously wrote in 1872:\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cem\\u003E\\\"We will not have questions answered by irrelevant agencies,\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOur husbands will not come to us, reeking with carnage,\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor caresses and applause.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOur sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAll that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe, the women of one country,\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWill be too tender of those of another country\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMrs. Howe worked with families on both sides of the Civil War and had seen some of its worst effects in the deaths, the disease, and the maimed soldiers. The economic devastation following the war was widespread ─ with crises in both the North and the South. She knew the vast effects of war go that beyond battle. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn 1870, Mrs. Howe determined that peace was one of the world's most important causes. She called for women to rise up and to come together across national lines, to recognize what we hold in common above what divides us, and to commit to finding peaceful resolutions to conflicts. She issued a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://womenshistory.about.com/od/howejwriting/a/mothers_day.htm\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EDeclaration\\u003C/a\\u003E, hoping to gather together women in a congress of action.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe play \\u003Cem\\u003ELysistrata\\u003C/em\\u003E famously featured women withholding sex from their lovers to end a war. Do you recall that there were real-life Russian women who, after years of war in Afghanistan, went onto the fields there to drag their men home? They were tired of it. They were not winning, and these were not jobs.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMore recently in 2003, Liberian women led a crusade against their country's conflict by withholding sex; then they forced the men who were lazily negotiating a peace agreement to speed up the process by encircling the building and not letting them out until they had a peace accord. It's a long story, full of heroines, but also of treachery and pain.\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2011/gbowee-bio.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E Leymah Gbowee\\u003C/a\\u003E received a noble peace prize in 2011 for leading that effort.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI don't ever see Mother's Day bringing a massive women's rally against war, but I do wish we could. In this country, we honor our soldiers, both men and women. Yet, and this is a big YET, sometimes we must say \\\"why?\\\" Which wars are worth the pain? The loss of blood and treasure? Would it not be a great day for mothers, and for fathers, not to have wars raging? Sons and daughters dying?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere are many who think that war is the only way to solve conflicts. Teddy Roosevelt, one of the more pugilistic presidents, said, \\\"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\\\" No one doubts that the U.S. has many big sticks. But speaking softly requires intelligence, patience, knowledge and the wherewithal to know full well what the outcomes of using those big sticks will be.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn today's world, 90% of the victims of war are civilians, and 70% of those are women and children and the elderly. Before the new style of war which fights in backyards, community and religious centers, farms and villages; soldiers were the victims. We have been fortunate not to have war raging on our soil.  If we did, how long would it be before we would be dragging our loved ones away from the battle?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWaging war is big business. Lots of money is made from preparing troops, guns, planes, bombs and ships. During World War II, factories stopped making their goods in order to make what was needed for war. They then returned to normal after the war. Now, factories are always at work making war stuff. It is part of our economy. And it is funded by us all with our taxes. Out of the discretionary budget that Congress appropriates each year and goes to all those things we love like education, health care, a clean environment, veterans benefits, etc. the Pentagon takes up 53%, plus, a slush fund for future wars.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI like Mother's Day, I really do. I love getting scribbled cards from my grandchildren and the thoughtful notes from daughters and my sons-in-law. I like wishing my mother were still here and I think about how much she did not like being celebrated for something she already thought was a gift. I like knowing if there were a mad rush to march against endless war, she would be there, as might millions more who decided it should be, as originally envisioned ─ a mother's day for peace.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n[Image Credit: U.S. National Archives, image is in the public domain.] \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:54:07-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-shaer/mothers-day-for-peace_b_7232770.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-shaer/mothers-day-for-peace_b_7232770.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:54:07 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Mother's Day for Peace"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:38 UTC +00:00]]

Smith\",\"description\":\"It's 9:30 on Sunday morning. I show up to work with my shirt buttoned to the collar and my boots shined to a glossy black. I choose not to wear a tie most Sundays. The chain on my wallet swings freely from my back right pocket as I swagger in, copy of the liturgy in hand. I'm an intern at First Church Congregational in Cambridge, a church in the United Church of Christ. I take our \\\"come as you are\\\" philosophy very seriously, showing up every Sunday as I am. A little bit rock and roll, and every bit as transgender as I was the day before. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOn this particular Sunday, I go to this week's adult formation hour called \\\"Learning About Gender\\\" led by my friend and fellow intern, Katie. In the three weekly sessions, she breaks down the differences between gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation. Someone asks how to talk about trans people in the third person. Another asks how to support a friend with a transgender child. A bold voice asks where God is in all of it. Katie turns the question back to the participants. There is no place God isn't. God is wrapped up in it. They are trying to understand. Throughout the session, I have to remind myself that people are at different levels of understanding when it comes to gender. I also have to remind myself that, though this is a progressive church, these discussions aren't had unless a trans person is there to lead them. I'm grateful to not have to lead.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI medically transitioned in 2009 wrapped in the love and support of my UCC church in Santa Cruz, CA. When I asked them to call me by a new name and different pronouns, they obliged. Some asked questions. Most were ready to take me as I was.  As I furthered my journey with hormones and eventually accessed chest surgery, their desire to understand grew deeper. They understood that they were on this journey right alongside me and that they needed to be able to be confident allies. The more I \\\"passed,\\\" the more I needed to remind them that we had come a long way to reach that place of understanding and that there is still more work to be done.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe national UCC has a reputation for extending a radical welcome to lesbians and gay men. It is beginning to pay more attention to the needs of transgender people as more of us come out in church. Workshops like the one Katie led are becoming more common, but are far from the norm. Individual congregations decide how far to extend that radical welcome, so it's hard to gauge whether a church that welcomes lesbians and gay men will be welcoming to trans people. Even with my passing privilege, I am more comfortable in a church that acknowledges that \\\"God is still speaking,\\\" as the UCC tagline goes, by its incorporation of gender-inclusive language into the worship service. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd God is still speaking. I hold on to my faith because I think it has transformative power. In church, I see people coming to the aid of others because they genuinely care, realizing that the life of the church depends on each member. We are invested in each other's lives such that we care for each other from the depths of love. In church, love is both a noun and a verb. It is something we work on constantly while doing our best to embody it.   \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLikewise, I see other transgender people working to make their world -- including their faith traditions -- a place where we can live without the fear of violence. Organizations like TransFaith are working hard to open hearts and minds to gender variation across faith traditions. The Center for Gay and Lesbian Studies at Pacific School of Religion has published a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.clgs.org/transitioning-inclusion-guide\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eguide\\u003C/a\\u003E for welcoming transgender youth and their families into church. In other instances, I see trans people with incredible faith, in God or some other higher power, working towards change through local action. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.twocc.us/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EThe Transwomen of Color Collective\\u003C/a\\u003E has been on the forefront of change by telling the stories and promoting leadership of transwomen of color. This organization is not faith-based in the way we think of \\\"faith-based,\\\" but I'd be hard-pressed to say that the women involved didn't believe in something. That \\\"something\\\" may be the power of change, the hope of liberation or some God somewhere. Whatever it is drives these women to continue. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe future of faith lies in how open we are to broadening its definition. Many of my trans friends have faith, though it's not necessarily in a celestial power or an earthly force. Their faith is in the love and support of the communities they have created for each other, knowing that their chosen families encircle them. Faith is not beholden to any particular religion. It is the thing that we cling to when life becomes unbearable. Some of us have been so wounded by religion that turning to it is unthinkable. But we can turn to our friends and the love they provide us day after day. This love is undeniable, often unbreakable, and most certainly worth clinging to. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI am a transman surrounded by a community that loves me so hard that I feel it each time I breathe. I am also a seminarian, so deeply devoted to my practice and faith in Christ that I am devoting my life to it. I hope that these two distinct pieces of my life can become more integrated as more churches open their doors and their pulpits to trans folks. Many already have. I am on an ordination track within the United Church of Christ, and I have several trans friends serving in churches across the country within the UCC, the MCC and Episcopal Church. We are only a few, but we few are the reason I am able to follow Jesus and serve the church. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:53:09-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/taj-m-smith/the-future-of-faith-from-_b_7188190.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/taj-m-smith/the-future-of-faith-from-_b_7188190.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:53:09 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Future of Faith From a Trans-Man's Perspective"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:38 UTC +00:00]]

Rough treatment of minorities by police is hardly unique to Baltimore.  Serious injuries and deaths are an all too common result.  This is not to disparage individual law enforcement officers, who have to negotiate a complex and often hostile set of relationships that are not of their making.  But again, this is not unique to Baltimore.  After Ferguson, and New York, and North Charleston, a spark was bound to ignite somewhere, and that place happened to be Baltimore.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI have lived in Baltimore for more than 40 years.  My wife and I have raised three children adopted from South America.  One of them identifies himself as black.  For years, he has told us stories of police harassment, being pulled over for \\\"driving while black,\\\" and being suspected of crimes he could not have committed.   This is reality.  I do not think there is any parent of a black child who does not understand this to be true, and who does not fear that an innocent act, a taunting remark, or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time could end up with real harm at the hands of the police.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut this reality exists in every big city.  Why was Baltimore the flashpoint?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne reason, ironically, is that Baltimore has been getting better.  A down-at-the-heels port city in the 1970s, it is now improving economically, socially, and physically.  Also, almost the entire power structure of the city is African American.  This includes the mayor, police chief, state's attorney, and other leaders.  An African-American middle class is growing rapidly, but moving to the suburbs.  Other middle class people are moving into city neighborhoods and adding vitality and new businesses.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHowever, the people left in the inner city are not benefitting from all of this change.  Many are unemployed or underemployed.  Too many are dropouts, or have such poor basic skills that they can only qualify for low-level jobs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe anger and frustration of many Baltimoreans is understandable.  They see people all around them, including people who look like them, entering the middle class.  But from their point of view, the American Dream remains unattainable.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy colleagues and I work in the schools that serve the very communities affected by the recent disturbances.  The children who come to these schools start off bright eyed and bushy tailed, full of enthusiasm and confidence, like children everywhere.  But then all too many of them experience failure.  And all that motivation drains away.  The majority of fourth graders read below the \\\"basic\\\" level on NAEP Reading.  Poor reading skills make it almost impossible for children to grow up with confidence, graduate from high school, and go on to college or high-paying jobs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNone of this is surprising to any educator.  But here is what should be infuriating:  SCHOOL FAILURE IS PREVENTABLE.  With every passing year we gain increasing evidence that virtually all children can learn to read and to succeed in other subjects.  Using EDGAR standards, I count 28 elementary reading programs ready for use today that have at least moderate evidence of effectiveness.  Yet none of these are used broadly enough to solve the reading problem in high-poverty schools.  There is no reason that every Title I school in America should not be using proven programs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe smoke rising over Baltimore in recent days is a signal to the whole country.  Until we make opportunities available to all and treat everyone with respect and dignity, we can expect the frustrations of those who are shut out to boil over.  Many things need to change, but one of the most fundamental is also among the easiest: make sure that every child, whatever his or her background, learns to become a successful and confident reader.  We know how to do it.  Now let's do it. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:51:37-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-e-slavin/the-message-from-baltimor_b_7231190.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-e-slavin/the-message-from-baltimor_b_7231190.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:51:37 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Message From Baltimore"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:38 UTC +00:00]]

You need the cooperation of your regulator to let you put this new set of capital investments into your business and charge your customers for it, but you have built in advantages over some poor HVAC installer trying to switch from putting air conditioners on pads to panels on roofs.

Yes, current oil prices are at a six year low, but almost no one believes this will last, and batteries, as mentioned earlier, are getting better and cheaper.  This plus climate change concerns inevitably lead to more and more plug in hybrids and full battery powered electric vehicles.  You will benefit from this, even if you do nothing, as all those cars will need daily charging.  Anything you can do to move this along, like investing in a network of convenient charging stations in your service territory, will put you ahead of the game and preserve your business.  And this investment will please your regulator, and is one that very few other businesses have the money or talent to undertake.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E3.\\tExpand your business horizons.\\u003C/strong\\u003E  Water is the next coming crisis.  Unfortunately water has been \\\"the next coming crisis\\\" for thirty years or so, but now maybe it really is.  California and many western states are in the worst shape, water wise, they have been for years, and there is little reason to think this will change soon.  The best solution, after conservation, is desalination systems.  And both of the principle technologies -- low pressure flash desal and reverse osmosis (\\\"RO\\\") desal, use lots of electricity.  The first kind is usually tied to the waste heat of a power plant and so has limited flexibility, but RO systems can function anywhere that there's salty water.  It is perhaps useful to point out that fracking uses a large amount of saline water that when spent currently is reinjected into deep brineous aquifers, at much expense.  It is not difficult to imagine setting up RO systems to solve both the potable water availability problems of the western US, and a portion of the environmental problems associated with fracking.  The RO systems are big and complicated and capital intensive, and thus a natural for a utility, who can now make both the power and the water that a developed country needs.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E4.\\tCannibalize your neighbors.\\u003C/strong\\u003E  If you're stuck in a state with a backward regulatory system, and you can't build solar or wind and put it in your own rates, then go next door and start stealing the customers of the next utility over.  You will need to do this in a non-regulated part of your business, but most utilities have long since established such structures, so this is not a problem.  You could even consider buying one of the competing solar rooftop companies to do this, like one of Solar City's smaller competitors, Vivint Solar or SunRun for example.  Your business next door will grow as it diminishes in your home state, and maybe at some point your regulator will come to his senses.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNo business likes to fail, and no business likes to change, especially ones that have had the luxury of a monopoly franchise for a product which is critical to modern society.  Today's utility doesn't have to fail, and can even lower the long run costs to its customers.

Then there are quotes, inspirational sayings and behaviours that add to that. I don't try to idolise people as you mostly only really see one facet of the person, not the real person. For example with Hilary Clinton, there are pieces from the things she says and facets she shows that I admire, but not necessarily the whole person, also because I do not know her well enough to know if I would like her or not.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\\"I admire the silent, genuine, authentic person, not someone who hides behind an image of what they want others to believe they are.

My personal role models are my father and mother. My father, because he endured great hardship during the war, lost his younger siblings due to hunger and worked hard all his life to give his children the best of everything. My mother, because she is the quiet, effective woman behind the scenes, who was able to handle my father's depression and who taught never to overlook the positive side of things.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat is your greatest achievement to date?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy greatest achievement is that I can do what I want, and have the freedom to work with people I respect and that I do not need to put up with \\\"jerks\\\".

I think each woman has to look at her own specific individual situation and find a solution that works for her and what makes her life meaningful to her. If you want to have an impact, you need to look at the problem. For example, on the topic of having more women on boards - I think that is too general. What we in fact need is a new board culture, with more diversity and inclusion that will naturally increase the number of women on boards. Throughout my career, I was not aware of the glass ceiling. I ignored it all the time and tried to strategically put myself in a unique situation. One boss advised me to do the things that nobody else wants to do, but with passion and dedication. By \\\"owning\\\" a niche you are also forced to think outside of the box. Plus it's more difficult to replace someone who owns a niche and adds something very specific to the company - it also puts you on management's radar. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy biggest challenge has been linked to stereotypes and to keep my own biases in check. I have found it easier to move ahead with people who are less emotional and more pragmatic and who put the task in the centre of their motivation and not themselves.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow do you grow people in your organization?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\\"I like the odd eggs in the basket, the people who stand out - be it shy or loud - and because they tend to be more creative and think out of the box.

For example, I convinced a rather shy woman on my team to do 20 hours of singing lessons to help her get out of her comfort zone, open her mind and do something she was not familiar with - the effect was amazing - for her and for us all.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\\"I think the further you move away from your comfort zone and go exploring, that's when you may find a hidden talent or - what is also important - something which makes it much easier to face and accept a weakness.\\\"\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen growing people, you find out what they can do better than you- that helps you to delegate better and helps you to keep your feet on the ground. It's important to give each team member the feeling that what they are doing has value for you and for the organisation. And encourage them to venture out - it gives them a different perspective, boosts their confidence, feeds their creativity and increases their satisfaction of working with you.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIf you could do 1 thing differently, what would it be?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI would go to University, not necessarily for myself, but to satisfy other people's need for the security of having a degree. I am a voracious reader, and consume books on every topic from India to philosophy. But some people and organisations absolutely require the security of that piece of paper. That has been the only stumbling block in my life so far, when I was being considered for a Board seat I was really interested in. Unfortunately, the criteria for the selection required a university degree and I did not get the seat. On the bright side, not going to university opened up time for me to be able to meet other people and push me out into a different environment, which made my experience unique.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHow would you describe your leadership style?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI would say my leadership style is based 100% on trust. I go by my gut feeling. When you work with me, you get my complete trust and loyalty.

I try to bring the individual \\\"instruments\\\" together which are necessary to perform the piece perfectly. I don't pretend that I can play each instrument myself.

When we start going in a certain direction, the whole team needs to be on board. A good leader has to be a good communicator and be able to set and manage the expectations of his/her team members and the \\\"satellites\\\" of the team.

A leadership style is a very personal thing and is also dependent on the personal life of the leader and what she is going through. For example, if a male leader is going through a divorce, that may affect the way he interacts with women back at work. Or, if your child is seriously ill, your leadership back at work will surely suffer. I don't believe in one type of leadership style, rather that it changes throughout your life as you mature, change and grow. And different tasks require different styles.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\\"A really \\\"mature\\\" leader, is her / his own worst critic, has an adaptive style and is empathic enough to form and maintain a team spirit. This leader does not choose the team members to serve best his style or out of nepotism but the ones who best serve the task. I believe you need to find the right leaders and people for each task / project to achieve a goal.

But what if I told you the majority of people that do succeed with paying down debt using debt settlement or credit counseling can be seen as having failed?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EYou see... problem debt is not always just a temporary setback that finds you stopping in the pit for a new set of rubber and some fuel, and then back out you go to zip around the track of life. In many situations, debt help is a long pit stop that involves a complete engine swap. Depending on the circumstances, you could be swapping for a four banger... for life.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe cost of consolidating credit cards into one payment.\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EAssume you are 30 years old and have $22,000.00 of unsecured debts (mostly credit card bills) that you can no longer afford due to job loss, or unforeseen expenses. You \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://consumerrecoverynetwork.com/credit-counseling-services-help-lower-credit-card-payments/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Econsolidate your credit cards into one payment\\u003C/a\\u003E working with a nonprofit counseling agency. Your new lower payment is more affordable, at say $418.00 a month. And you are set to pay that same monthly amount over 60 months, for a total repayment of roughly $25,000.00. You complete the plan and feel like the biggest weight of your life has been lifted, and you do not look back.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EIf you do not look back, you will not see that the real cost of your consolidated repayment was not 25 thousand dollars. It was as much as $590,000.00 if you were to have instead contributed that same $418.00 into a retirement fund for that 5 years; for a total of roughly 32k; with an average return of 9.74%; until you reach a retirement age of 65.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ELet's take the same scenario and apply it to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://consumerrecoverynetwork.com/what-is-debt-settlement/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Esettling debt for less\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EAssume the $22,000.00 total debt can be settled for less than the balances owed over a period of 24 months by saving up $418.00 every month and not paying your credit cards. You end up paying about $10,000.00 to settle and will be out of debt. That time and lost opportunity could result in long term losses of roughly $270,000.00 were that money placed into a similar retirement fund using the example above.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EI invite you to take your own financial and age example and use the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://getoutofdebt.org/51244/debt-repayment-calculator-retirement\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Edebt repayment impacts my retirement\\u003C/a\\u003E calculator that I used for the above examples. The calculator is half way down that page.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EConsolidating your monthly credit cards for a single lower payment appears like the longer pit stop where you might as well be swapping out your balanced and weighted high performance engine for a four cylinder. But settling debt for less still looks like your trading down your future financial power, just not as much as bill consolidation. But make no mistake; you are giving up major performance.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Ch2\\u003EComparing the cost and time frames for debt help with chapter 7 bankruptcy is both simple and complicated.\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ESimply put, chapter 7 on average could cost between $1,500.00 and $1,800.00 from start to finish, and take as little as 90 days. For many people that would be the equivalent of three months worth of minimum payments on 22k of credit card debt. What are the longer term implications of this on your future financial potential? As a friend of mine, Steve Rhode put it in a recent email exchange on the topic:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003E\\\"People are emotionally subject to valuing immediate items more importantly than future items.... Ultimately the question seems to be if someone is willing to throw away what may amount to a million dollars or more in retirement for the emotional satisfaction of repaying their debt in a long term plan when the debt could be eliminated quickly and for not much money.\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EThe complications with deciding to make a quick vs long financial pit stop over problem debts do not originate with the math. The math clearly favors chapter 7 bankruptcy. The complications are introduced by our individual emotions, and the perceptions of the conventionally wise.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EHow wise is it to call losers winners anyway (those that applaud your having avoided bankruptcy)? And how much do people driving around in 4 bangers lead to congestion for everyone else driving our nation's economic highways?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is not just about how debt help right now leads to less of an ability to pay for tomorrow. Let's assume someone is never going to take that $418.00 a month after filing chapter 7 and focus on funding their retirement account. People trading down their personal financial performance to fix a debt problem from yesterday, or today, are not contributing to their local and regional economies while they are off the track, or running at lower speeds. This means fewer jobs nationally and globally. Fewer jobs mean less demand for goods and services. This in turn means fewer jobs, even less demand and a feedback loop.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EThink the problem is small? I am only talking about revolving consumer debts. Being strung out on student loans is an even bigger concern. Add student loans to the mix and the economic issues surrounding debt help are compounded.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EBut this is only the part of the problem that is immediately visible. The bigger story is hidden and not being talked about, and has much bigger implications for every one of us on the track.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen we swap out our future financial performance and ability to fend for ourselves, those costs are going to be passed on... to everyone. Unless you see a future where it is a societal norm to regularly overhear people discussing which cat food they prefer to eat, there will be a safety net for those without one. The cost of that safety will be borne by society. That cost will be borne by all of us.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EI understand there are strong opinions about how individuals should go about resolving problem debts. I have advocated consumers speak with a credit counselor, a debt settlement professional, and a bankruptcy attorney. And only after they feel they have all the information to compare, then choose the best way out of debt.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter more than 20 years of working with people to resolve debt problems, I am of the opinion that debt help and conventional wisdom should not be \\\"you can \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://consumerrecoverynetwork.com/find-bankruptcy-attorney/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Elook at filing bankruptcy\\u003C/a\\u003E as a last resort if you have to\\\", but rather \\\"too bad you could not get back on the track with chapter 7\\\".\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ci\\u003EThis article by Michael Bovee first appeared on \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://consumerrecoverynetwork.com/debt-help-advice-costs-you/\\\"\\u003EConsumer Recovery Network\\u003C/a\\u003E and was distributed by the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://PFSyn.com\\\"\\u003EPersonal Finance Syndication Network\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/i\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Clink rel=\\\"canonical\\\" href=\\\"http://consumerrecoverynetwork.com/debt-help-advice-costs-you/\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cmeta name=\\\"syndication-source\\\" content=\\\"http://consumerrecoverynetwork.com/debt-help-advice-costs-you/\\\"\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:46:13-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-rhode/why-a-chapter-7-bankruptc_b_7232654.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-rhode/why-a-chapter-7-bankruptc_b_7232654.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:46:13 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Should be Your First Option and Not a Last Resort"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:38 UTC +00:00]]

The Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Index rose 5% year over year in February.  This was compared to a 4.5% rise in January.  The February gain was the largest monthly gain since July 2014.  Of course, real estate is local, and some markets like San Francisco and Denver are doing so well they're skewing results to the upside.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ESupply and Demand Factors\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMarkets, whether real estate or groceries, all respond to supply and demand pressures.  And there are a three supply factors and one demand item that are putting upward pressure on prices.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EHomeowners aren't Selling - Supply\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough the number of existing home sales has been rising consistently, the increase hasn't been enough to spur homeowner to enter the market as sellers.  Many are still underwater, owing more on their homes than they're worth.  Many others do not have enough equity to pay sales costs and pocket any money, so they're in a holding pattern.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany are concerned that even if they can sell with some equity that they will not be able to find another suitable home.  They see prices rising, but because a lot of the reason is low supply with rising demand, they are not sure that there is another home out there right for them at this time.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBuilders aren't Building - Supply\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLast year only about 700,000 new single family homes were built.  This is far below what is considered a normal market, so the supply is low for new homes.  Builders are reluctant to build on spec, adding inventory when they don't see adequate demand.  Their financing is still more restrictive than before the bust, so extra scrutiny goes into starting new projects.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFewer Foreclosures Suitable for Retail Buyers - Supply\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen foreclosures were pouring into the market right after the bust, many were occupied by the owners and were in livable condition.  They didn't need extensive rehab work.  These homes qualified for mortgage loans, so retail buyers were able to grab them up.  Now the situation is different.  Most of the foreclosures are abandoned home in poor to terrible condition.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nInvestors are loving these as fix \\u0026 flip opportunities, and the competition for them is causing prices to go up on the front end, resulting in increases at the sale end of the flip.  There is less fix \\u0026 flip to rental investors, with an increase of flipping in the retail market.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMortgage Rates are Still Low - Demand\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFreddie Mac reports that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 3.56% compared to 4.33% at this time last year.  This helps to grow demand with more people able to qualify for higher priced homes with the lower mortgage payments available.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOpposing Forces\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n There are a couple of opposing forces holding back more demand and even higher prices.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETight Lending Rules\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nLenders are still being stingy with mortgages.  Tighter lending qualification requirements are keeping many buyers out of the market.  There is some loosening, but it's a far stretch from the liberal lending practices prior to the crash.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EGeneral Economic Concerns\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe outlook for jobs isn't looking particularly rosy, and wages are pretty much stagnant.  There is a general concern for job security and economic prosperity among consumers.  High student debt and poor job prospects are keeping graduates out of the first time buyer mode.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo, with a 4-to-2 score, four positive factors and two negative, prices are still rising.  It's not a bubble ... yet.  As prices continue to rise, more homeowners will see enough equity to consider selling, so this could increase supply and offset some of the price pressure.  However, there is also some evidence that first time buyers are returning to the market.  It's going to be an interest year for housing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-graziosi/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFor More Real Estate Articles Click Here!\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:44:38-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-graziosi/whats-up-with-home-prices_b_7225650.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-graziosi/whats-up-with-home-prices_b_7225650.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:44:38 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What's UP With Home Prices?"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:38 UTC +00:00]]

So, she packed up the kids and took off in the family car on the 50-mile drive without him.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis may sound like a typical marital dispute over a family visit. However, on this occasion it wasn't just any husband and wife. And it wasn't just any car. The year was 1888. The couple was Carl and Bertha Benz. And the car was the car -- the world's very first -- making its inaugural long-distance drive without its inventor at the controls (although in tribute to Bertha's ingenuity she fixed a clogged fuel line with her hat pin along the way.)\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen I think of how the past relates to the future of the automobile I first think of this story. It is a wonderfully human illustration of how, beginning in the late 19th Century, the car provided a life-changing luxury: the ability to go where you want when you want. As the car became more affordable, that luxury became indispensable. By providing individual mobility it has gone on to enable economic and social mobility for generations of people.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor that same reason the global auto industry is very much a growth industry today. As the standard of living rises around the world, more and more of us get where we need to go, when we want to go. The world auto market is expected to climb by about 30 percent to sales of almost 100 million passenger cars per year by 2025. That nets out to 270,000 new cars each and every day. Luxury vehicles, such as those from our Mercedes-Benz brand, provide more affluent and discerning customers with the things we typically associate with high-end products. Mercedes' definition of those core attributes includes leading safety and comfort, efficient power, advanced technology, high-level service, superior quality and a premium \\\"look and feel.\\\" We consider these to be a ticket of entry for today's premium buyers. The wants and needs of today's luxury car buyers are building from there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlong with generally rising customer expectations, a main driver of change in our industry is the global trend of urbanization. Every day more than 200,000 people across the world move to already densely populated cities or huge suburbs. So, it's only getting more crowded in our metropolitan areas and on our roads. In response, among the most precious luxury goods of the 21st century are private space and quality time. And the automobile is well positioned to deliver both.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOver the coming decade we see luxury cars turning into exclusive \\\"cocoons on wheels\\\" that enable people to do exactly what they want or need to do -- sleep, work, browse the web, make conversation, or simply enjoy some rare solitude -- as they get where they need to go. The key enabling technologies here are those that support autonomous driving.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis is not an entirely new field. Mercedes first started working on self-driving cars almost 30 years ago. We proved back then that the technology could work, but at the time concluded it was both too big and expensive for commercialization. Vast improvements in sensor technology and computing capabilities, coupled with a dramatic drop in cost, have since changed the value equation.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOver the past several years we have been introducing components in our cars, in the form of driver assistance systems, which will ultimately enable fully autonomous driving. Our current C-, E- and S-Classes, for example, are equipped with more than 20 assistance systems built around integrated software, cameras, radars and sensors. They allow the car to take over a growing number of functions such as emergency braking, assisted parking and driving in stop-and-go traffic. As our customers experience these new self-driving capabilities they gain confidence in them. And we are convinced: Their confidence will rapidly turn into fascination -- as the remaining legal and technological challenges are resolved.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe recently built a prototype of our vision of the car of the future, dubbed the \\\"F015 Luxury in Motion.\\\" We introduced it at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. It embodies our thinking of redesigning the car from scratch in order to maximize those new luxuries of private space and quality time. You'll see most if not all of this technology in the not- too-distant future.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn a nutshell, the concept is about designing the entire car around the advantages of autonomous driving, while making use of the added room available in an electric car absent conventional engine and transmission technology.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe outer appearance of the F015 has a clear and clean shape. We moved the wheels to the very edges of the car to maximize a luxurious living space that is precious, private and highly personalized. It builds on the idea of providing a \\\"third place\\\" where people will want to spend their valuable time -- in addition to their homes and offices.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe F015 has no buttons as controllers. The digital and the physical world seamlessly blend as its windows serve as screens. When the car is not in self-driving mode any of its passengers can take over that function with a free-floating control unit. All relevant driving information, surrounding traffic and points of interest can be viewed on the big dashboard screen or heads-up display. Key functions are controlled by eye-tracking. Once activated, choices are made solely by gestures.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe car also actively communicates with its outside world. For example, LED lights in the front follow pedestrians' movements and reassure them it \\\"sees\\\" them, while lights in the back alert the upcoming traffic that there is a person ahead. The car also communicates with other vehicles and traffic infrastructure to maximize safety and minimize drive times and traffic congestion.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe list of F015's features and capabilities goes on and on. Ultimately, they combine to serve a single purpose: Redefining luxury. That definition, by the way, may no longer include exclusive ownership. We also see tremendous potential for car-sharing with autonomous vehicles. Imagine using an app on your smartphone to execute the micro rental of a luxury vehicle and the vehicle drives itself to pick you up. That adds a whole new dimension to \\\"going where you want when you want.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nNeither Bertha nor Carl Benz could have imagined the automotive technologies and capabilities that are just around the corner today. For example, two years ago, a Mercedes-Benz S-Class drove the historic route of Bertha Benz again -- but this time fully autonomously. So, when I look at the next 10 years of automotive luxury, one thing is for sure: They will definitely be very exciting. The best is yet to come.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ci\\u003EThis post is part of a series commemorating The Huffington Post's 10 Year Anniversary through expert opinions looking forward to the next decade in their respective fields.

Used with permission.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIrvin D. Yalom is as well known a writer of fiction as he is of non-fiction. His novels include the famous \\u003Cem\\u003EWhen Nietzsche Wept\\u003C/em\\u003E (a tour de force rendering of the relationship between Freud's mentor, the renowned Dr, Joseph Breuer, and the philosopher Frederick Nietzsche), \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Schopenhauer Cure\\u003C/em\\u003E and the most recent, 2012's \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Spinoza Problem\\u003C/em\\u003E. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe is also the inventor of a new non-fiction form, in which the psychiatrist Dr. Yalom describes conversations he has had with some of his most challenging patients. One such is his new book, \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Creatures-Day-Other-Tales-Psychotherapy-ebook/dp/B00NP8ME3A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books\\u0026ie=UTF8\\u0026qid=1430867282\\u0026sr=1-1\\u0026keywords=Irvin+D.+Yalom+Creatures\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ECreatures of A Day, and Other Tales of Psychotherapy\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E, which was published this year by Basic Books. The best known of Dr. Yalom's non-fiction books is \\u003Cem\\u003ELove's Executioner\\u003C/em\\u003E, which, as well as possessing one of the most compelling titles ever, contains the equally appealing passage from which the title is taken: \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003EI do not like to work with patients who are in love. Perhaps it is because of envy -- I, too, crave enchantment. Perhaps it is because love and psychotherapy are fundamentally incompatible. The good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection. I hate to be love's executioner.\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI spoke with Yalom recently, interested in why he writes both fiction and non-fiction. I wanted to ask him which of these forms he prefers, and what does each form require of him that the other does not. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E:  I have a lot of blurring between fiction and non-fiction in so many of my works. For example, my first novel, \\u003Cem\\u003EWhen Nietzsche Wept\\u003C/em\\u003E, has a great deal of non-fiction in it. I didn't create many characters at all. Almost all of them are historical characters that actually existed. Now, I consider that almost like having written fiction with training wheels. Everything, historically, was already there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the next novel, \\u003Cem\\u003ELying On The Couch\\u003C/em\\u003E was entirely made up, and I felt then that, really, I was jumping off into fiction. I'm reading that novel now again, though, for a memoir that I'm writing, and I'm amazed by how much non-fiction there actually is in it. A lot of instances from my past life that I attribute to the characters. Many things from my own past are in there. Even some of the characters' names... I changed them around, of course, but some of them are very similar to the names of people I actually have known.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSomething like that takes place in my non-fiction stories, too... the blurring, I mean. Those stories all have fiction in them. First of all, I have to change almost all the details of a physical, factual nature in the story, in order to protect the identity of the patient. I've changed men into women. I've made tremendous alterations in the characters. In essence, though, the main character remains as he or she really is, and I will have changed certain features of their appearance or personality.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIncidentally, despite all this, I ask each of the people, on whom patient conversations have been based in a particular story, to read my final story. All of them have approved.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut here's something about those stories. One of my most read books is actually a textbook titled \\u003Cem\\u003ETheory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy\\u003C/em\\u003E. The individual stories in that book, of patients in group therapy, are true. I really was trying to find my wings as a writer at that time, and I am certain -- I have no question in my mind at all -- that the reason that book is so successful is that it contains those stories, which I bootlegged into the book. Legions of students have told me that what they really like are the stories. They can put up with a lot of dry theory (\\u003Cem\\u003EYalom grins.\\u003C/em\\u003E) if they know that another story is coming around the bend in a few minutes.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETC\\u003C/strong\\u003E: What impact has your being so well known as a writer had on your practice as a psychiatrist?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E: I'd love to write about that some time. Now, literally every patient I see has come to me because of something I've written, and that does have a significant impact upon the course of the therapy. It makes me into a bit of a larger-than-life figure for the people I see, and maybe potentially it even gives me more power to do good, as long as ultimately I can get past their need to see me as a special sort of figure. I don't want to be idealized by a patient because of what I've written.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETC\\u003C/strong\\u003E: Is writing fiction more, or less, difficult for you to write than non-fiction?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E: I enjoy writing fiction more. I have had great experiences... adventures! When I've been writing a novel. And now, my inclination is to continue writing only fiction. You know, I'm a compulsive reader of fiction. I fell in love with novels when I was a teenager. My wife Marilyn and I... our initial friendship began because we are both readers. I've gone to sleep almost every night of my life after having read in a novel for 30 or 40 minutes. I'm a great reader of fiction, and much less so of non-fiction.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETC\\u003C/strong\\u003E: Would you consider writing fiction that does not have a basis in psychiatry? Would you go farther afield?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E: I can imagine doing that, but even then, my work would be categorized by its looking at internal issues, by how people think, by what consciousness is like. I don't think I could write a mindless detective story.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn a new afterword for the 2012 re-release of \\u003Cem\\u003ELove's Executioner\\u003C/em\\u003E, Yalom writes, \\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\\"I had always wanted to be a storyteller. As long as I can remember, I've been a voracious reader and somewhere in early adolescence I began yearning to be a real writer. That desire must have been percolating on the back burner as I pursued my academic career, for as I began writing these ten stories [for \\u003Cem\\u003ELove's Executioner\\u003C/em\\u003E] I sensed I was on the way to finding myself.\\\"\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs fictional elements pervade his non-fiction, and as actual facts determine much of the action of his fiction, Yalom's devotion to both is clearly evident, and functions on equal terms, the one with the other. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003ETerence Clarke's latest novel\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Notorious-Dream-Jesus-Lazaro/dp/0986058238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\\u0026qid=1430868711\\u0026sr=8-1\\u0026keywords=Clarke+The+Notorious\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThe Notorious Dream of Jesús Lázaro\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cem\\u003Ewas published earlier this year.

It is not to be taken literally.\\\" The point of these charts is to act as a guide for where the shading and highlighting should go. He's noticed that these contouring lines are becoming more and more prominent on Instagram and now in some YouTube tutorials. Heavy under-eye concealer to brighten the face and ultra-sculpted cheek bones are becoming a part of the daily makeup routine for more and more girls.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"We're now doing every single thing and then pairing it with a heavy eye and a heavy lip and then we're putting even more powder on that than you can possibly imagine.

They do not realize that they are requesting \\u003Cem\\u003Edrag\\u003C/em\\u003E makeup. He believes we should all adopt the amazing drag techniques into our makeup routines but in very softened, subtle ways.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe is also concerned that girls are beginning to forget the 'clean beauty' look. \\\"Clean beauty doesn't mean you can't have a heavy smoky eye or a strong lip.

You won't find horse-drawn carriages, steam trains or gas lamps, but you might well find the kinds of urban centers that once drew waves of immigrants: tightly settled, integrated communities with busy streets, active local commerce and small manufacturing industries. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA decade from now, the hearts of some of our largest cities will no longer be defined by gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by well-manicured corporate plazas. These trophy buildings, and the broad avenues that flank them, will still exist -- but as a secondary part of what draws people to live in a city. The pulse of our metropolitan cores will be found in places where people live, work and play -- mixed-use communities whose combination of old and new buildings, green space and tarmac will redefine life in the central city.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany of the world's global cities are well on their way to this future -- Paris, London and Berlin to name a few. So, too, are some of America's largest metropolises, including places like Chicago and New York. Their downtown business districts are home to some of the nation's foremost companies, and their retail is second to none. Yet the most vibrant and fast-changing parts of these cities are no longer their shopping corridors or the skyscrapers that define their skylines.  They are places like the South Loop in Chicago or downtown Brooklyn in New York -- where the mix of residents and workers means that day turns seamlessly into night with little diminution of activity.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cp class=\\\"pull-quote\\\" style=\\\"width: 90%; margin: 40px 3%; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; color: #787878;\\\"\\u003E\\\"A decade from now, the hearts of some of our largest cities will no longer be defined by gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by well-manicured corporate plazas.\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor students of urban history, these emerging 24/7 communities harken back to colonial times -- when living and working were tied to one and the same place. The merchants and craftsmen of the pre-industrial period -- whether in London or New Amsterdam -- typically sold their wares from storefronts they lived above or behind. The street served as a stage for a never-ending show of people, commerce and movement. So it remained until growing industrialization prompted a separation of the two: those who could afford to live in quieter, cleaner places away from the places of commerce and industry did so, though often only a short carriage or trolley ride away from their office, factory or shop.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe separation of work and home would be expanded greatly in the 19th and 20th centuries -- first with the debut of rail service to outlying areas and then with the introduction of the automobile. The advent of the highway in the mid-20th century made it particularly easy to live far from the dirt and dangers of the city, hollowing out the hearts of some of our greatest cities and leaving behind compromised transit systems and a legacy of fear and poverty.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the last several decades have seen the pendulum swing back to the city, thanks to increasing congestion on metropolitan roadways, the rise of the environmental movement and the lure of the urban lifestyle. Public and private investment in the regeneration of former industrial areas is transforming city centers and bringing people and commerce to communities and neighborhoods once left for dead. In many of these places, homes and businesses are more seamlessly intertwined than ever before -- no longer segregated by restrictive zoning or by societal mores.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Cp class=\\\"pull-quote\\\" style=\\\"width: 90%; margin: 40px 3%; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center; color: #787878;\\\"\\u003E\\\"Investment in the regeneration of former industrial areas is transforming city centers and bringing people and commerce to communities and neighborhoods once left for dead.\\\"\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe parameters of the 24/7 community of the future are coming into focus in these places. The \\\"\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.citylab.com/crime/2013/07/new-way-understanding-eyes-street/6276/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eeyes on the street\\u003C/a\\u003E\\\" that Jane Jacobs spoke so eloquently of are now present in many of these revitalized communities -- in new and rehabilitated buildings, in reimagined central squares and in more integrated forms of social housing. The results are impressive: the return of families, the growth in the number of older residents, a decline in crime and an intense colonization by youth.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe businesses that make up these central, mixed-use communities are changing as much as the people who now elect to live there. Corporate behemoths once attracted solely to central business districts have increasingly chosen to relocate to cheaper sites outside of central city areas; in their place have \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/211970/forget-big-suburban-campuses-innovative-corporations-are-moving-downtown/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ecome\\u003C/a\\u003E smaller creative, technology and manufacturing companies. Conversion of space from commercial to residential has further diversified the economic base of these areas and given life to new and different forms of retail offerings.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis movement of people back into our older cities is forcing a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pps.org/reference/boldmovesandbraveactions/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Erethink\\u003C/a\\u003E of the structure and levels of investment in our public transit systems. The legacy transit systems that fell into disrepair as the auto age gained momentum -- buses, trains and other forms of mass transit -- are now seen as heralding a brighter environmental future to young people who have little interest in owning a car. As a result, even older systems like New York's subway are experiencing \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20141022/TRANSPORTATION/141029938/subway-ridership-hits-record-high\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Erecord volumes\\u003C/a\\u003E -- justifying further investment and helping to further reduce the number of cars on the congested roads of the metropolis.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOther forms of civic infrastructure are changing, too, as they adapt to the new patterns of settlement. Investment in urban parks is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324507404578591893956006764\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eon the rise\\u003C/a\\u003E, albeit much of it coming from private sources. These range from pocket parks, adopted by local groups or corporations, to central gathering places, like Millenium Park in Chicago or Central Park in New York, to new linear parks along once-active waterfronts or rail lines. More and more of these once-forgotten spaces will become cherished resources for workers, tourists and residents.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut perhaps the greatest gains to come are in community -- and in the way people feel about the places in which they live. Reclaiming the city for residents has given voice to the need for investment at the local scale -- in street furniture, in trees, in road safety and in transit -- and in the democratization of that voice. The \\\"\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/nyregion/participatory-budgeting-opens-up-voting-to-the-disenfranchised-and-denied.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eparticipatory budgeting\\u003C/a\\u003E\\\" now underway in many cities, in which citizens vote to determine the use of allocations of capital funding in their neighborhood, is still in its infancy, but is nevertheless an important harbinger of things to come.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhat does this add up to a decade from now?  Urban neighborhoods in our older cities will be greener, with more trees and parks. Retail offerings will be stronger and more diverse, buoyed by the power of the 24/7 economy. The narrow, congested streets of these early cities will be shared more symbiotically -- by more pedestrians and fewer cars. Sidewalks will be wider and cleaner, and bikeways will be more prevalent. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe city will, in short, regain its human scale and emerge once again as a series of communities -- completing a fascinating journey back to the future.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003CHH--236SLIDEEXPAND--423568--HH\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:40:08-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-ascher/future-america-cities_b_7215710.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-ascher/future-america-cities_b_7215710.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:40:08 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Future of America's Cities Lies in the Past"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:39 UTC +00:00]]

I had been in the beauty industry for more than 20 years, and I realized what inspired me most was how our industry had spearheaded the breast-cancer movement, raising awareness about the importance of early detection, as well as millions of dollars for research to help erase the \\\"death sentence\\\" of a breast-cancer diagnosis. I decided I wanted to work for a company that was involved in that, too, so I only had one choice -- L'Oreal USA joined forces with the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF) and embarked on a special mission to eradicate ovarian cancer. Since then, L'Oreal USA has become a top fundraiser for the OCRF searching for a cure for ovarian cancer, one of the toughest cancers to diagnose and treat.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI quickly discovered that while rewarding, it was not enough just to raise money -- I needed to be hands on. I wanted to understand what research we were funding and what progress we were making on the survival rate. I also found myself wanting to spend time with survivors, and helping them feel better in whatever way I could. Thus my pledge to fight ovarian cancer evolved into other commitments -- like supporting the Look Good Feel Better campaign, which targets the personal fight of those diagnosed with cancer. It is amazing what beauty tutorials and a little make-up can do for these brave individuals' self-esteem. Moreover, seeing the direct impact beauty products can have on reversing the tolls of chemotherapy is one of the most validating parts of being in the industry. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEven deeper inspiration can be found in the courageous cancer survivors that are a part of my day-to-day life at L'Oreal. Our very own Tim Quinn, Celebrity Makeup Artist for Giorgio Armani Beauty, has fought his own battle with cancer and was treated at the Mass General Cancer Center. He was honored at the one hundred in 2011 for his philanthropic efforts in the fight against cancer. He shares personal anecdotes -- from decorating his hospital room to putting lipstick on his nurses -- with others to make the fight seem a little more manageable. Tim is one of the most magnetic, thoughtful and generous people I know and his personal commitment to \\\"make cancer pretty\\\" has inspired me to grow my support. Thus it is a natural extension to join forces with Mass General's the one hundred. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBeing honored at this year's the one hundred is in support of every brave individual who has fought cancer, and especially Tim -- to celebrate his personal fight against cancer and his valiant efforts to help boost other fighters' morale. In addition to making top stars like Glenn Close and Kerry Washington look gorgeous on the red carpet, he finds time to make sure everyone feels beautiful. Today I am going to see Tim in action at the Mass General Nurses' Appreciation Day event, where he and his team will be giving the incomparably hardworking and dedicated nurses of the Mass General Cancer Center well-deserved makeovers and beauty advice. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile Tim and I use our passion for beauty to support the fight against cancer, I hope this hits a broader note and inspires others to use their interests toward philanthropic goals. It only takes a little lipstick to boost the self-confidence of a woman going through chemotherapy, and in the same fashion, it doesn't have to take an entire corporation to make an impact. I encourage you to run with what drives you and use it for the greater good. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThis blog post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and \\u003Cstrong\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.theonehundred.org/?utm_source=huffpost\\u0026utm_medium=referral\\u0026utm_campaign=theonehundred\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ethe one hundred\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/strong\\u003E, in conjunction with the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.massgeneral.org/cancer/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMassachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center\\u003C/a\\u003E.

Over the past six months, we've been working alongside our agency partner, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.codeandtheory.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ECode And Theory\\u003C/a\\u003E, to reimagine the HuffPost experience for the mobile-global-social world we now live in.  Along the way, we've learned a lot about what is truly important to us here at HuffPost and to the digital media world at large.  These are some of the things we've learned in the process, and will continue to focus on as we grow as a global media company over the next 10 years.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMobile is the future, and the future is now\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you're reading this on desktop, you might be asking yourself: what redesign?  That's because the HuffPost redesign took a truly mobile-first approach.  We've launched on mobile web this week, and will roll out a new look on desktop and our apps in the coming months.  Mobile accounts for 50 percent of HuffPost's traffic globally -- in Korea alone, that number rises to 85 percent. That is why it was (and will continue to be) paramount for us to optimize the user experience for our mobile users. We don't believe in scaling back a desktop design to fit mobile, potentially removing functionality in the process. Instead, we have an independent and highly flexible codebase dedicated to our mobile properties so that we can let our readers experience all of our content in the best way possible on mobile devices. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431009809-1825612-PhotoNumber1.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-07-1431009809-1825612-PhotoNumber1.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431009809-1825612-PhotoNumber1-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"799\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThink globally, act globally, grow globally \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhen AOL bought HuffPost in 2011, we had 30 million unique visitors and zero international editions.  Now as we mark our 10th anniversary, we have 214 million UVs, and by the end of this summer we'll have 15 international editions in 10 languages.  Most importantly, though, half of our audience now comes from outside the U.S., and we are well on our way to building a truly global newsroom.  In order to get there, we need every HuffPost employee to think globally, which is why we put in a tremendous amount of work to ensure that phase one of the redesign was 100 percent global in scope. The mobile web redesign was deployed simultaneously across all of our international editions and gives readers amplified access to our worldwide coverage, regardless of which languages they speak. The new mobile site allows readers the option to seamlessly switch between editions and supports translations across all of our international editions.  It also makes it clearer when content is coming from a foreign edition. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431009850-7947258-PhotoNumberTwo.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-07-1431009850-7947258-PhotoNumberTwo.png\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431009850-7947258-PhotoNumberTwo-thumb.png\\\" width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"798\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EEvery page is now a \\\"front page\\\"\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWith more and more traffic coming in through the \\\"side door\\\" -- that is, from external referrals like search and social to specific articles - every article now acts as a gateway to the rest of the site.  Of course, HuffPost retains a healthy amount of direct traffic, particularly to our front page.  But we're also consistently the #1 publisher on Facebook, and a significant portion of HuffPost's traffic comes through social referrals to article pages.  This is especially true on mobile (though our mobile site does have a beautiful new home page, including a mobile-friendly take on our signature splash).  To accommodate this, we're treating every page like a front page, giving readers more opportunities to find relevant and interesting HuffPost content from the mobile web article itself through infinite scroll, related content and personalized recommendations.  And, because sharing is a core behavior of the HuffPost reader, we've developed a new strategy around microsharing, giving readers more opportunities to share elements of content from article pages, whether headlines, videos, quotes or photos. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431009888-1851033-PhotoNumber3.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-07-1431009888-1851033-PhotoNumber3.png\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1431009888-1851033-PhotoNumber3-thumb.png\\\" width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"798\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELaunch in phases, and iterate quickly\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWe could have spent more than a year preparing to roll a redesign out across multiple platforms, or wasted months debating which shade of green to use in our logo header. Instead, we decided to stay true to our startup roots and launch quickly with a minimum viable product (MVP) for mobile web in less than six months.  We'll be tracking user behavior closely so we can iterate on the design as we learn what works in real time.  There's a lot more to come.  Tablet and desktop are coming soon -- stay tuned! And in the meantime, feel free to email your thoughts, complaints or suggestions to mobilewebredesign@huffingtonpost.com\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAlways choose performance over \\\"pretty\\\"\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere was one point during our redesign when our editors fell in love with a font and we had to tell them that we couldn't use it because the files were too heavy and it would destroy our page load time.  This underscored a really important lesson for us: for HuffPost, performance takes precedence over prettiness.  Getting stories out to our readers in real time has always been our priority, especially on mobile web.  With each iteration of our mobile web site, we've improved page load time around the world.  This launch is no different; we even gave our new fonts a \\\"speed test\\\" to ensure that they wouldn't impact the speed of the site (they don't).  We'll continue to maintain (and improve) our best-in-class performance target of rendering content under 1,000 milliseconds and offering the best possible experience to our readers. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:39:27-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-freeman/5-lessons-from-the-huffpost-mobile-web-redesign_b_7227926.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-freeman/5-lessons-from-the-huffpost-mobile-web-redesign_b_7227926.html"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:39:27 UTC +00:00], ["title", "5 Lessons From The HuffPost Mobile Web Redesign"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:05:39 UTC +00:00]]

Where did you grow up?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI grew up moving around all my life. I grew up all over the East Coast, down South and Midwest. We moved at least once a year, so by the time I was 14, I counted, and we had moved about 16 times. So in terms of having a geographic place where I grew up, I don't really have that, it's more of those parts of the country.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDo you remember first becoming interested in art? \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was fortunate enough to grow up in a house where my mom was really aware that I loved to draw, that I could entertain myself for hours that way, and she was really supportive of that. When I was in grade school, she got me this book called \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-Doesnt-Frighten-Maya-Angelou/dp/1556702884\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ELife Doesn't Frighten Me\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E, and the text was a poem by Maya Angelou. And the poem was pieced together with different Basquiat paintings. The words and the paintings, the way they came together -- that's something I'll always remember as part of my artist roots. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlso, my father was incarcerated on and off my whole life, in different states than I lived. So our main mode of communication was by letter. He'd hire artists that he was locked up with to create portraits of us. I loved Garfield, I was a huge fan, and he had his cellmates draw Garfield cartoons for me. I remember the images more than I remember the verbal correspondence. It was this connection that was created between us, even through that separation. So, in that way, I was really nurtured by visual art and images growing up.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDo you recall initially realizing the homogeneity of the Western canon of art history? What was your reaction?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou know, it's almost like elevator music when I think about that. It's like background noise in that, I did, like all of us have, see it all. But it never stuck with me, it was never the thing that really grabbed me or caught my attention. And it wasn't anything necessarily I could relate to. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI went to this arts camp when I was a little older and they would take us on trips to the art museums in the area and that was the first time that I really saw museum art. That was the first time I interacted with those kinds of works and that kind of canon. And then later when I went to art school I was like, \\\"\\u003Cem\\u003Ewhoa\\u003C/em\\u003E!\\\" I realized then that when they're teaching art history, that pretty much means European art history. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"bone\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2921204/thumbs/o-BONE-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Csmall\\u003EBone Oracle\\u003C/small\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EDid this realization impact your practice?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'm really thankful for that education and how rigorous it was. However, one thing I was really not ready for was how Eurocentric the curriculum was. On the one hand it's important to understand it, seeing as it's a part of the history of the art world, and on the other hand it was so exhausting. It just made me think: \\u003Cem\\u003EWhat am I even doing here?\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt wasn't just art history, but it was also playing into the politics of aesthetics, what could be discussed rigorously and critiqued. I just got this point where I decided I was only going to draw queer, femme, brown and black people. That's all it's gonna be. I've kind of evolved past that at this point but it was a really clear decision. Being so hungry for it and deciding I was going to create it.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIs this related to what you refer to in your statement as the future femme myth? Can you expand on what exactly that means?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYes, that exploration is something that I'm going to be excited to think about for a long time. I was creating these portraits in a series called \\\"Femme Gold\\\" and I was rendering queer femmes of color and trying to expand what that could look like. I was asking -- how do you represent the aesthetics of queer femininity, without placing the body in relationship to someone else. What is the aesthetic of queer femininity when its not dependent on who's gazing? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI was thinking about that and I had this personal breakthrough that I had made this decision to move away from the European canon and art history and yet I was still using the same rules of proportion and scale and portraiture. Even though I was trying to use different symbols, the vehicle I was using was based and rooted in classical European tradition. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThen I thought to myself, okay, if not that, where will I look for guidance? And I started becoming inspired by all these pre-Columbian artworks and looking a lot at alchemical illustrations that used visual language as a text to be read. I'm super inspired by \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.sayawoolfalk.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ESaya Woolfalk\\u003C/a\\u003E as a contemporary artist who is calling upon the aesthetics of ancient and folk art. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"sooth sayer\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2921220/thumbs/o-SOOTH-SAYER-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Csmall\\u003ESooth Sayer\\u003C/small\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EAnd how did the futuristic aspect come into play?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI'm a super big sci-fi nerd and I started thinking about the future. There has been an upsurge in post-apocalyptic, sci-fi and fantasy narratives, and I started to experience this hunger for a different narrative, a different story being told. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere's this idea within that world of future myths that the future equals more masculine, more tech-focused. It shows up in the narratives dealing with outer space versus Earth -- we're leaving the world that we messed up behind, and who are we taking with us? How is that future being portrayed? I was looking at something like \\\"Star Trek,\\\" which is pretty diverse for when it was made, and then looking at something like \\\"Battlestar Galactica,\\\" which is like this huge decline in representations of diversity of the human race in the future. I started getting interested in that combination. What is queer femme aesthetic? And how to we begin to visualize ourselves as marginalized people in the future, calling upon ancient, present and future imaginings? \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOne of the most pronounced features of your work are the multiplicity of eyes that surround many of your bodies. What prompted you there?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt's a symbol that is appealing to me because it's pretty global in terms of all the different representations of spiritual texts and ancient art texts across the board.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAlso, I'm curious about the aesthetics of holiness and eyes have this divine omnipresent awareness to them, something that's contained all around us and within us. Eyes are symbols of protection, symbols of sovereignty. I place them everywhere to show that they're totally accessible. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"call back your magics\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2921228/thumbs/o-CALL-BACK-YOUR-MAGICS-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Csmall\\u003ECall Back Your Magics\\u003C/small\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThe women you depict are powerful, and yet don't don any of the markers we traditionally associate with strength or authority. How did you go about creating your own system of visual power? \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSomething I'm interested in is thinking about the feminine as a presentation or a play or a creative force in the world. I, personally, have used hair and makeup and clothes as armor. I feel like our culture diminishes women and those choices are considered unintelligent. Like, \\\"Oh, you wear too much makeup.\\\" Or, \\\"Why are you wearing heels?\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn this way, it's a tactic of people trying to bring the feminine down, implying that those choices aren't intelligent and aren't informed. And I'm thinking about the ways that they really are -- they really are intelligent about how we fit in the world, especially as queer femmes. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI also am interested in cuteness as a sense of armor. Looking at that in caterpillars and butterflies and all of these small creatures that have made themselves appear a certain way to be protected. How do \\u003Cem\\u003Ewe\\u003C/em\\u003E make ourselves seem larger than life? Cuteness and femininity can be a source of protection and a source of fierceness. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"weave\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2921248/thumbs/o-WEAVE-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Csmall\\u003EWeave (for Swallow)\\u003C/small\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECan you describe the process of naming your works? \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIt started when I was was looking at a lot of ancient works and pre-Colombian art. Let me just say: I am not a historian, I am not a scientist. I do not know anything about the extensiveness and rigor of the processes of uncovering these histories. But from the outside looking in, as an artist, there was something really humorous to me about the authority involved in these histories. Who is coming up with this shit? Who is saying \\u003Cem\\u003Ethis\\u003C/em\\u003E is how it was?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI became curious about this voice of authority, who is telling the history, whose history is being canonized as myth and whose history is being categorized as truth. I started to think about using authority as a medium to play with. To use language as my own sense of authority and sovereignty and dominion over whatever it is I'm making. I think having a mixture of play and power behind the intentionality of language is important in my work. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYour statement mentions the influence of Donna Haraway's \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Cyborg Manifesto\\u003C/em\\u003E on your work. Can you describe what, specifically, inspired you about the text?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nTo be totally honest, \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Cyborg Manifesto\\u003C/em\\u003E was something I read in school. I don't know how anyone would read it outside of school because it's so academic. Reading it, I remember feeling this frustration around protection of information. This cloaking of information in really academic language. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut I gave it some more time, and there were pieces that really spoke to me, about creation myths and disassembling the systems of history, disassembling systems of language and power and rearranging them. It also spoke to me in how I think queerness functions as a healing force in the world -- breaking down different structures and systems and rearranging them in a way that is catering to the full expression of someone's soul. It's about deconstructing what we've inherited as our origins. And being able to piece them back together in a way that serves the whole expression of who we are as human beings. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"doc\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2921236/thumbs/o-DOC-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Csmall\\u003EDocumentation of a Ghostin\\u003C/small\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMoleski's work is on view alongside that of Sheena Rose in \\\"Vision Quest,\\\" which runs until May 31, 2015 at \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://mocada.org/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EMoCADA\\u003C/a\\u003E in Brooklyn, New York.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstyle type=\\\"text/css\\\"\\u003E.articleBody div.feature-section, .entry div.feature-section{width:55%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;} .articleBody span.feature-dropcap, .entry span.feature-dropcap{float:left;font-size:72px;line-height:59px;padding-top:4px;padding-right:8px;padding-left:3px;} div.feature-caption{font-size:90%;margin-top:0px;}\\u003C/style\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:29:48-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/amaryllis-dejesus-moleski_n_7225618.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/amaryllis-dejesus-moleski_n_7225618.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:29:48 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Creating A Visual Language For Queer, Brown Femininity -- On Its Own Terms"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:08:16 UTC +00:00]]

However, for Boston-based photographer \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.laurabethreese.com/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ELaura Beth Reese\\u003C/a\\u003E, the idea of reconnecting with a previous lover was intriguing. The possibility of revisiting the passion of a past relationship, rekindling the fond memories two people once shared, no matter how forced the scenario, was too tempting to resist. And since she's a photographer, she brought her camera along for the ride.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"For as long as I can remember I’ve had a difficult time letting go of past relationships, whether they be romantic or not,\\\" Reese explained to The Huffington Post. \\\"Even though I understood why my relationships ended, I could never completely move on. Whether I was with someone for a month or a year, I continued to love them in some way after the relationship was over. Truth be told, I missed them. I thought photographing them would give me an excuse to see and reconnect with them again.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"laura\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2915616/thumbs/o-LAURA-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nReese reached out to old flames from throughout her life via Facebook and email, whether they dated at age 13 or 24. \\\"When I began the project, I thought that taking the photographs would help me reclaim some of the power that I felt I had lost in the relationship,\\\" she explained. \\\"But what I found is that they actually have all of the power. Rarely do they just agree to be photographed with no strings attached. They often want something in return.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAccording to Reese, the portraits are most often taken in the subjects' homes, with very little planning done beforehand. The whole ordeal takes from one to two hours, though, from Reese's description, it feels like much longer. \\\"Photographing an ex-boyfriend is a very uncomfortable and awkward situation to begin with so I am generally a mess during the shoots,\\\" she said. \\\"I forget steps, drop things, and fumble around. I’m not able to handle myself with the grace and poise that I wish I could, which makes me feel really exposed and defenseless.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"laura\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2915622/thumbs/o-LAURA-900.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe resulting images, often featuring a stripped down subject in his or her underwear, radiate an unsettling combination of intimacy and rigidity. From one angle the subject appears like a lover, from another, a total stranger. The dynamic of the room is nearly impossible to read, at once emanating both heat and frost. The tension is palpable.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"I think the fact that the process and these photos are completely staged helps to emphasize the idea of the series. I’m using the pictures as a way to reconnect with the men from my past, but it’s a very forced and contrived connection. I wouldn’t even be with them if I weren’t making the photographs for the project. I think by staging the portraits they often end up being really rigid and awkward, which reflects the reality of what was happening when I was taking the picture.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBreakups are rough for countless reasons. Through her work, Reese goes where few have gone before -- back into the bedroom of a lost love in an attempt to capture the closeness they once shared. \\\"To me, the series is about the nature of intimacy,\\\" Reese said. \\\"I’m thinking about what it means to be intimate with someone and different ways that we as humans connect with each other. It’s not really about getting closure, but about being close with someone that I care about and working with that person to try to make an interesting and beautiful photograph.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003CHH--236SLIDEEXPAND--423302--HH\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstyle type=\\\"text/css\\\"\\u003E.articleBody div.feature-section, .entry div.feature-section{width:55%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;} .articleBody span.feature-dropcap, .entry span.feature-dropcap{float:left;font-size:72px;line-height:59px;padding-top:4px;padding-right:8px;padding-left:3px;} div.feature-caption{font-size:90%;margin-top:0px;}\\u003C/style\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T10:14:31-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/laura-beth-reese_n_7214756.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/laura-beth-reese_n_7214756.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 14:14:31 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Photographer Snaps Portraits Of Her Exes, Embraces The Awkwardness Of It All"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:08:16 UTC +00:00]]

But there is nothing that feeds dance as well as the high-level formation of young dancers and the ethic that promotes. The Colburn program as an integral part of the Colburn School is able to provide pre-professional training for students that is unusually rigorous and deep. Jenifer and James are in the studio every day with their 12 first year dancers, ranging in age from 14-18, setting the bar high. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430946678-2023219-IMG_2284.JPG\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430946678-2023219-IMG_2284.JPG\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430946678-2023219-IMG_2284-thumb.JPG\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"427\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EColburn student Nicholas Rose kicks high at rehearsal.

It wasn't written in real-time, but was revealed in 140-character (or less!) spurts, beginning with the tweet above. Her Twitter fiction isn't just easy-to-digest writing; according to North, Egan's work in the medium offers something traditional stories don't have. She \\\"plays with chronology,\\\" North asserts. \\\"With the idea of these updates that could add up to be a whole.\\\" It doesn't hurt that the story was constructed from witty sentences that work as one liners, such as, \\\"It is technically impossible for a man to look better in a Speedo than in swim trunks,\\\" and, \\\"A hundred feet of blue-black Mediterranean will allow you ample time to deliver a strong self-lecture.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough humor is key in the Twitterverse, it can be too easy to recede to stories propelled only by their ability to induce a chuckle.

I was very fortunate to go to a school that had an art therapy degree in undergrad. Combining my love of the practice of art and psychology, and getting to help people in need, it was a perfect fit for me.

Maybe they have stomach aches or headaches or trouble breathing. Using the art to help show that, so they can be more connected to how their bodies are responding, and then explore ways of coping through the art to help with those responses. So art that focuses on self-regulation or soothing or relaxation, through painting or drawing, mask making or things like that. Also using art intervention themes that focus on things like sadness, pain, worry, fear, anger. With these kinds of threatening feelings, it's often easier to explore them through art, than to talk about them verbally.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"art therapy\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2863738/thumbs/o-ART-THERAPY-570.jpg\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat advantages, in your opinion, does art therapy provide children over other types of counseling or treatment?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nArt making is a natural expression for children. They're very open and ready to engage with it. It really helps build that sense of self and emotional expression. Giving them that at a young age, hopefully while they're still in childhood, will hopefully help them be stronger as they move through adolescence and into adulthood, and be more able to develop those coping skills. There's that innate, imaginative ability that's not so censored in them yet. Adults often say, \\\"I can't draw,\\\" which isn't important -- art therapy is about the process, not the product -- but it's nice to work with kids who don't have that anxiety.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat kind of progress have you witnessed in your time working with children?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOccasionally I've seen people I used to work with as adults, still in difficult situations and trying to find their way. I've definitely seen the process come full circle. Changes can also be seen within the art that a feeling -- such as worry, anger, or sadness -- is not as consuming as it was depicted before, or the child's sense of self and their ability to cope has strengthened. Art therapy can be a helpful intervention for stabilizing overwhelming emotional states and crisis situations because of the safe containment it provides.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ECan you talk a little about the meaning and importance of Children's Mental Health Day? \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis year is actually the 10th anniversary, so Children's Mental Health Day has been going on for a while. I think it's very helpful to have a day spotlighting children's mental health. It fosters a sense of hope for recovery and builds resilience for these issues. It also raises awareness to help with prevention and early intervention, helping children to be less at risk for mental health issues. The day also helps to take away the stigma attached to mental illness, getting that out of there early on and getting children more aware of the mental health needs that they may have. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstyle type=\\\"text/css\\\"\\u003E.articleBody div.feature-section, .entry div.feature-section{width:55%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;} .articleBody span.feature-dropcap, .entry span.feature-dropcap{float:left;font-size:72px;line-height:59px;padding-top:4px;padding-right:8px;padding-left:3px;} div.feature-caption{font-size:90%;margin-top:0px;}\\u003C/style\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T08:19:26-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/art-therapy-children_n_7113324.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/art-therapy-children_n_7113324.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 12:19:26 UTC +00:00], ["title", "How Art Therapy Can Help Children Facing Mental And Emotional Challenges"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:08:16 UTC +00:00]]

That is increasingly true for those of us who are more ordinary, not possessed with the same imagination.

Perhaps the source of their creativity, and its result, is that ambiguous status: dynamic, in transit, unsettled and unsettling. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-07T07:17:31-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-h-wu/the-essential-chineseness_b_7230610.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-h-wu/the-essential-chineseness_b_7230610.html?utm_hp_ref=arts&amp;ir=Arts"], ["published_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 11:17:31 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Essential Chineseness of Ai Wei Wei, Guiseppe Castiglione, and Hung Liu"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:08:16 UTC +00:00]]

It was deeply ingrained in my belief system. I would think about phrases like \\\"poor starving artist\\\" and \\\"feast and famine are part of an artist's life\\\". It was a nonsensical belief system that was very damaging to my motivation. I literally believed all artists or creative's had a hard time. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430947342-2805449-towel.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430947342-2805449-towel.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430947342-2805449-towel-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI also felt like if I enjoyed my work and my creative projects, somehow I shouldn't be paid properly or at all. Because I get joy from design, writing and art it used to be hard to expect actual money from being creative. Some people don't value the arts as much as others. I have found a wide range of appreciation towards artistic projects from other people. Many people I have met have a great appreciation for design, writing and paintings. Other people I have met don't value it at all. So as you can see the attitude and value is very different depending on the person viewing the work. How you value your own work is the most important part when getting over old crappy belief systems. You must believe you are good enough and talented enough. The rest falls into place with more confidence each step of the way. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy second belief deeply ingrained in me was if people thought I was creative they did not think I was business savvy. So I had a silly thought that I could not be creative and business smart at the same time. I held onto this conflict for most of my life. I am now 38 and realized a couple of years ago that I needed to change my inner thoughts around creativity, business and art. My life and business changed drastically, once I switched my thinking around.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. Find some audio tapes so you can replace your belief system around feeling like a starving artist. \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nStart listening to people, podcasts and audio that speak highly of creativity and art. Invite people into your life that respect and admire your work. Focus on telling yourself the opposite of what you believe about money and creativity. I personally found I had to completely change my way of thinking around my work and what I have to offer the world. It took serious focus and quite of bit of time listening to other positive words around the subject. Audio tapes about positive thinking, business and art became my new best friends. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2.

The more you feel inhibited, do the opposite and jump into your creative side, go for it. Use the fear like it is oil to fire.

So I switched my thinking and read as much business and marketing books I could possibly get my hands on. I hated this thought at first because all I wanted to do was design, draw, sketch, paint and write! It felt awful at first but once I took control, I felt so much better. The best part was, I felt more confident about my work in every way, including business. As soon as I faced my fears, I started earning more money for my creative efforts. The results felt instant!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E4. Vulnerability brings great lessons in life. \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBeing vulnerable with your art, writing and creativity can be a huge step for some, including me. I always shied away from truly putting myself in front of people. I really disliked the feeling of possibly being rejected or feeling judged. I decided that my vulnerability was just what I needed to go forward. Nowadays if I feel vulnerable I take it as a sign that I need to do more of it. The rebel side of me comes out and I just make the leap into the unknown and see what happens. Feeling rejected is all part of the process. Of course we are going to get rejected sometimes but you can't get a big fat \\\"yes\\\" if you don't try. Trust me, the uncomfortable feelings soften and become less of an issue, the more you simmer with your own vulnerability. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430948075-3169133-femalelookingbeyond.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430948075-3169133-femalelookingbeyond.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430948075-3169133-femalelookingbeyond-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"570\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E5.

You may need to back away from friends or family for a little while, until you get grounded on your new way of looking at creativity. For me, if I honor my ideas by executing them and being true to myself I then value my work in a much higher regard. Taking yourself seriously and working hard, can increase your creativity and trusting the process can open up opportunities as if by magic. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDo you like this blog?

This is a sad, yet true occurrence affecting many communities. \\\"What I think is so amazing about the place is the knowledge that before the construction of the L.A.

One of my paintings in this show, 'Reflection On The River We Built' looks at the beauty in what initially might be viewed as not so beautiful. It takes the viewer down into the LA River - a stray traffic cone in the foreground, concrete and steel bridges overhead, power lines in the distance, and all in glowing reflection on the river.\\\" For the past 10 years, Rick's work has been shaped by concerns about water use. She keeps a constant watch on her ecological footprint. \\\"I believe that we can be better stewards of our environment, more efficiently utilizing the water that we do have.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430943003-6515143-5May9GaySummerRick_ReflectionOnTheRiverWeBuilt_30x30in_OilonCanvas.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430943003-6515143-5May9GaySummerRick_ReflectionOnTheRiverWeBuilt_30x30in_OilonCanvas.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430943003-6515143-5May9GaySummerRick_ReflectionOnTheRiverWeBuilt_30x30in_OilonCanvas-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"550\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EImage courtesy of artist; Gay Summer Rick, Reflection On The River We Built, 30 x 30 inches, Oil on Canvas, Palette Knife Painting\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs is the tradition of the Porch Gallery Ojai, on May 9, an artist talk moderated by Koll will commence at 4 p.m. next door to the gallery (at Modern Folk Living).

This man is incredibly arrogant and his actions and words reveal his ignorance.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEvaristti had a unique method of reasoning behind his unauthorized artistic technique: \\\"I do not ask for permission because nature belongs to no one.\\\" Unfortunately, laws aimed at protecting Iceland's delicate landscape were not on his side. The artist has since been sentenced to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3055145/Chilean-artist-jailed-dyeing-Iceland-s-famous-natural-hot-spring-PINK-food-colouring.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E15 days in jail\\u003C/a\\u003E. Additionally, Eiríks­son hopes for an apology.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nWhile the results of Evaristti's act are pretty, altering natural landscapes in any way should be done with caution. As Eiríks­son further explained, the residue from the food coloring has not radically altered the geyser itself, but it has spread to the ground surrounding Strokkur. The nearby ice and water could retain the red color for an extended period of time.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThis isn't the first time Evaristti has given Mother Nature a makeover with his artwork. He called this current project \\\"The 5th Pink State,\\\" as it's the fifth time the artist has accomplished such a feat. His previous works include \\\"The Ice Cube Project\\\" (2004), \\\"The Mont Rouge Project\\\" (2007), \\\"The Arido Rosso Project\\\" (2008) and \\\"The Red Crack Project\\\" (2013).\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"I love Mother Na­ture,\\\" the artist has said. \\\"If I love a woman I give her a diamond ring.

His novels include the famous \\u003Cem\\u003EWhen Nietzsche Wept\\u003C/em\\u003E (a tour de force rendering of the relationship between Freud's mentor, the renowned Dr, Joseph Breuer, and the philosopher Frederick Nietzsche), \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Schopenhauer Cure\\u003C/em\\u003E and the most recent, 2012's \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Spinoza Problem\\u003C/em\\u003E. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHe is also the inventor of a new non-fiction form, in which the psychiatrist Dr. Yalom describes conversations he has had with some of his most challenging patients. One such is his new book, \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Creatures-Day-Other-Tales-Psychotherapy-ebook/dp/B00NP8ME3A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books\\u0026ie=UTF8\\u0026qid=1430867282\\u0026sr=1-1\\u0026keywords=Irvin+D.+Yalom+Creatures\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003ECreatures of A Day, and Other Tales of Psychotherapy\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E, which was published this year by Basic Books. The best known of Dr. Yalom's non-fiction books is \\u003Cem\\u003ELove's Executioner\\u003C/em\\u003E, which, as well as possessing one of the most compelling titles ever, contains the equally appealing passage from which the title is taken: \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003EI do not like to work with patients who are in love. Perhaps it is because of envy -- I, too, crave enchantment. Perhaps it is because love and psychotherapy are fundamentally incompatible. The good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection. I hate to be love's executioner.\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI spoke with Yalom recently, interested in why he writes both fiction and non-fiction. I wanted to ask him which of these forms he prefers, and what does each form require of him that the other does not. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E:  I have a lot of blurring between fiction and non-fiction in so many of my works. For example, my first novel, \\u003Cem\\u003EWhen Nietzsche Wept\\u003C/em\\u003E, has a great deal of non-fiction in it. I didn't create many characters at all. Almost all of them are historical characters that actually existed. Now, I consider that almost like having written fiction with training wheels. Everything, historically, was already there.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut the next novel, \\u003Cem\\u003ELying On The Couch\\u003C/em\\u003E was entirely made up, and I felt then that, really, I was jumping off into fiction. I'm reading that novel now again, though, for a memoir that I'm writing, and I'm amazed by how much non-fiction there actually is in it. A lot of instances from my past life that I attribute to the characters. Many things from my own past are in there. Even some of the characters' names... I changed them around, of course, but some of them are very similar to the names of people I actually have known.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSomething like that takes place in my non-fiction stories, too... the blurring, I mean. Those stories all have fiction in them. First of all, I have to change almost all the details of a physical, factual nature in the story, in order to protect the identity of the patient. I've changed men into women. I've made tremendous alterations in the characters. In essence, though, the main character remains as he or she really is, and I will have changed certain features of their appearance or personality.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIncidentally, despite all this, I ask each of the people, on whom patient conversations have been based in a particular story, to read my final story. All of them have approved.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut here's something about those stories. One of my most read books is actually a textbook titled \\u003Cem\\u003ETheory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy\\u003C/em\\u003E. The individual stories in that book, of patients in group therapy, are true. I really was trying to find my wings as a writer at that time, and I am certain -- I have no question in my mind at all -- that the reason that book is so successful is that it contains those stories, which I bootlegged into the book. Legions of students have told me that what they really like are the stories. They can put up with a lot of dry theory (\\u003Cem\\u003EYalom grins.\\u003C/em\\u003E) if they know that another story is coming around the bend in a few minutes.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETC\\u003C/strong\\u003E: What impact has your being so well known as a writer had on your practice as a psychiatrist?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E: I'd love to write about that some time. Now, literally every patient I see has come to me because of something I've written, and that does have a significant impact upon the course of the therapy. It makes me into a bit of a larger-than-life figure for the people I see, and maybe potentially it even gives me more power to do good, as long as ultimately I can get past their need to see me as a special sort of figure. I don't want to be idealized by a patient because of what I've written.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETC\\u003C/strong\\u003E: Is writing fiction more, or less, difficult for you to write than non-fiction?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E: I enjoy writing fiction more. I have had great experiences... adventures! When I've been writing a novel. And now, my inclination is to continue writing only fiction. You know, I'm a compulsive reader of fiction. I fell in love with novels when I was a teenager. My wife Marilyn and I... our initial friendship began because we are both readers. I've gone to sleep almost every night of my life after having read in a novel for 30 or 40 minutes. I'm a great reader of fiction, and much less so of non-fiction.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ETC\\u003C/strong\\u003E: Would you consider writing fiction that does not have a basis in psychiatry? Would you go farther afield?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EIY\\u003C/strong\\u003E: I can imagine doing that, but even then, my work would be categorized by its looking at internal issues, by how people think, by what consciousness is like. I don't think I could write a mindless detective story.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn a new afterword for the 2012 re-release of \\u003Cem\\u003ELove's Executioner\\u003C/em\\u003E, Yalom writes, \\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\\"I had always wanted to be a storyteller. As long as I can remember, I've been a voracious reader and somewhere in early adolescence I began yearning to be a real writer. That desire must have been percolating on the back burner as I pursued my academic career, for as I began writing these ten stories [for \\u003Cem\\u003ELove's Executioner\\u003C/em\\u003E] I sensed I was on the way to finding myself.\\\"\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAs fictional elements pervade his non-fiction, and as actual facts determine much of the action of his fiction, Yalom's devotion to both is clearly evident, and functions on equal terms, the one with the other. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003ETerence Clarke's latest novel\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Notorious-Dream-Jesus-Lazaro/dp/0986058238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\\u0026qid=1430868711\\u0026sr=8-1\\u0026keywords=Clarke+The+Notorious\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EThe Notorious Dream of Jesús Lázaro\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cem\\u003Ewas published earlier this year.

He told The Huffington Post, \\\"A story should do four basic things: obviously it should tell a story; it should be entertaining; it should be thought-provoking; and, if done well enough, it should invoke an emotional response. And if a writer can do that with a story that's 140 characters or less, even better!\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSo, brevity isn't the only qualifier for a narrative told online. In fact, most Twitter fiction stories are composed of several tweets, and so are characterized not only by pithiness, but also the social nature of the form. Neil Gaiman's \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Hearts-Keys-and-Puppetry/dp/B0037MA85U\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EHearts, Keys and Puppetry\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/em\\u003E, for example, has a unique byline: it was authored not only by him, but also \\\"the Twitterverse.\\\" Urged to tack sentences onto Gaiman's bombastic first line of a fairy tale, readers hashtagged their way to a complete story. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ESam was brushing her hair when the girl in the mirror put down the hairbrush, smiled \\u0026 said, \\u0026quot;We don't love you anymore.\\u0026quot; \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/BBCAA\\\"\\u003E@BBCAA\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcawdio?src=hash\\\"\\u003E#bbcawdio\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E— Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/4837873679\\\"\\u003EOctober 13, 2009\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cscript async src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/script\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough both reading and writing are traditionally solitary acts, participants in this year's #TwitterFiction Festival will employ tactics similar to Gaiman's; \\u003Cem\\u003EIf I Stay\\u003C/em\\u003E author Gayle Foreman asked followers to tweet a sentence she could use as a jumping-off point. She'll craft her performance around an entry of her choice, making for a less collaborative but still technically crowd-sourced experience.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnna North, author of \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Life and Death of Sophie Stark\\u003C/em\\u003E, will be offering both previously published flash fiction stories and crowd-sourced works. She likens the latter to performance, where “even if there’s just laughing, there’s feedback from the audience.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe cooperative nature of Twitter fiction isn’t the only thing that appeals to her; she says its inherent brevity allows writers to use flash fiction to tackle esoteric topics that might not be worthy of entire novels. One such topic she's devoted many super short stories to is polar exploration. \\\"I started to write about a polar explorer who was doing these bizarre things, like doing surgery on himself,\\\" she told The Huffington Post. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nA successful Twitter fiction story, she added, achieves a tone that's absurd, powerful, \\\"and also maybe a little bit funny.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EPeople rarely look the way you expect them to, even when you’ve seen pictures.\\u003C/p\\u003E— New Yorker Fiction (@NYerFiction) \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/NYerFiction/status/205812891583131648\\\"\\u003EMay 25, 2012\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cscript async src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/script\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJennifer Egan's short story \\\"Black Box\\\" ticks each of these boxes. It wasn't written in real-time, but was revealed in 140-character (or less!) spurts, beginning with the tweet above. Her Twitter fiction isn't just easy-to-digest writing; according to North, Egan's work in the medium offers something traditional stories don't have. She \\\"plays with chronology,\\\" North asserts. \\\"With the idea of these updates that could add up to be a whole.\\\" It doesn't hurt that the story was constructed from witty sentences that work as one liners, such as, \\\"It is technically impossible for a man to look better in a Speedo than in swim trunks,\\\" and, \\\"A hundred feet of blue-black Mediterranean will allow you ample time to deliver a strong self-lecture.\\\" \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThough humor is key in the Twitterverse, it can be too easy to recede to stories propelled only by their ability to induce a chuckle. Which might not be such a bad thing, as Amelia Gray, author of the flash fiction collection \\u003Cem\\u003EGutshot\\u003C/em\\u003E, demonstrates with her take on Hemingway's notorious story: \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EFor Sale: baby shoes, worn a lot.

It is a grueling tale that takes place over decades with the uniting of two hearts being forever out of reach. The narrator, Wylie Rose, and the object of his ardor, Cesca Bonet, are constantly at cross purposes but this passionate relationship still sears the pages of Dubow's book.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe story is told from Wylie's viewpoint as he reflects back on the first few decades of his life. He recalls how he was introduced to the Bonet family as a young teenager. The Bonets were a wealthy artistic family who lived close to the Rose's family home in the Hamptons. There were four Bonet siblings, two boys and two girls. Wylie became particularly close to Aurelio, a boy who had incredible artistic talent. And from the start he worshipped Francesca \\\"Cesca\\\" Bonet, a beautiful young woman a couple of years his senior, who fascinated young Wylie to the point of obsession.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nHis love for her is not all one sided as Cesca has \\\"moments\\\" she professes she loves him too, but every time he feels he has a commitment of sorts she manages to slip through his fingers. When this happens he swears it will be the last time he makes a fool of himself, but obsession is a strong drug from which he can not disconnect himself.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nDubow cleverly pulls the readers into the affair and lets them feel Wylie's frustrations. At times one becomes tired of Wylie's slavishness, but his persistence is realistic since Cesca is described as so alluring. Dubow has created a woman who is both mysteriously appealing and coldly repulsive. At times Cesca can be self destructive to the extreme to herself and to her relationships, but then she can quickly win back the hearts of those she has alienated.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nOne flaw in Dubow's writing is his tendency to introduce people who move in the circles of the very rich and very artistic. In many instances he will describe these individuals, giving clues to their identities and then move on without naming names. It is a worthless waste of story time and slows the pacing.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIf you are a romantic you will devour every page of this book, for it is a love story that thrives within Dubow's pages. You might not admire Cesca and her choices but you will remember her long after the pages of her story have ended. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EGirl in the Moonlight\\u003C/em\\u003E is published by Morrow.

I wanted to immerse myself as much as possible, because I didn't feel fulfilled in my day job as a financial news editor. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI wanted to write articles that help people and it's becoming more difficult for authors to sell their books to readers. My articles could help them reach the audience they're looking for.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nInitially I signed up to write feature articles on authors for Examiner.com. When I went to an open house at the home of Charles Salzberg (co-founder of New York Writers Workshop) in Manhattan, on New Year's Day in 2013, I met lots of writers and scheduled interviews with them. They referred me to other published authors and one of those writers was Jamie Brenner, a romance novelist. I told her my goal was to do book reviews and host readings and she said, \\\"You don't need Examiner.\\\" And I thought, she's right!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy mom came up with the name, At The Inkwell, and I designed the website in two days.  I didn't leave that chair for an entire weekend, working nonstop on no sleep. I wish I could say the same for my writing!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI approached KGB Bar with a proposal to host readings. I had had a prior relationship with hosting readings at the bar in the summers of 2011-2012 under my former reading series and workshop, The Writer's Corner. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt The Inkwell had its first reading (romance night) on March 8, 2013 at KGB Bar. Shortly after that, I started writing book reviews, but I couldn't keep up with the demand on my own. Today I have nine book reviewers from Seattle to D.C.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELK: What have been some of the challenges of kicking off a reading series? Any divas yet?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMAL: I had a big learning curve. My original idea was to give readers a mix of genres in one night, whether it was poetry, fiction or non-fiction. That didn't work for the crowd or the author. Once I booked a dark humor writer with a literary adult novelist and the crowd didn't respond to the former's writing. He was really disappointed, and I felt awful because I should have booked him with writers in the same genre. A few months later, I did just that with the same humor writer. He sold books and people laughed at all the right parts. I was happy to have a successful do-over with him.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI have had a few divas and when I encounter such people, I remind myself that I can't please everyone nor should I take their rude behavior to heart. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELK: Often writers are greeted with small audiences, poor acoustics and lack of preparation at readings. After all that work to get booked, a crowd is the most important and often shows that the curator worked to promo the event. What does At the Inkwell do in terms of promo and what value can writers expect from reading at this venue?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMAL: The beauty about my series is the space. People always say how much they love the environment at KGB Bar and how perfect it is for a reading. The venue has to be inviting and welcoming to an audience or people might not return. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt The Inkwell is one of 13 running series at the bar, and I have to promote the readings on my own to compete with readings across the city.  I tweet and post about each reading on Facebook along with email announcements. I also make sure to book one to two authors who will bring a large crowd. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMy series has been really promising for authors in terms of attracting large crowds, reaching a new audience and selling books. At KGB Bar, the author keeps 100 percent of all proceeds.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFinally, the reading series has connected writers to literary agents. One NYC agent signed a writer who read in my series.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELK: How is At the Inkwell different from every other series in NYC? \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMAL: Most series cater to one specific genre but my series showcases a variety of genres and sub-genres.

Every fiction writer I know is happy to have the statement included on the first page of his or her book. It's as much a protection for the author as the copyright and ISBN number. Now that being said, if we're at all truthful with ourselves, authors know that many times parts of a character in our stories are based on someone we have known or have met. Ninety five percent of the time the resemblance actually \\u003Cem\\u003Eis\\u003C/em\\u003E coincidental. The character quirk or physical description of someone is already in the back of the writer's mind and fits a certain character in the story.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBasing certain traits on an actual person, living or dead, is one thing but the question most authors of fiction get asked by readers is, \\\"Is the main character in your stories anything at all like you?\\\" I'd have to say that it is true for many writers. We may be creating fictional stories but the fictional characters in them have more than a bit of the creator.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBesides writing other best-sellers such as the \\u003Cem\\u003EDelilah Street\\u003C/em\\u003E series and the \\u003Cem\\u003EIrene Adler\\u003C/em\\u003E series,  author Carole Nelson Douglas is also famous for her \\u003Cem\\u003EMidnight Louie\\u003C/em\\u003E books where her main character, Temple Barr, owns a black cat with highly-tuned detective skills. Carole Nelson Douglas is a cat lover and has had many \\\"Midnight Louies\\\" in her life. That characteristic of hers is shown in the fictional owner of the literary Midnight Louie. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSara Paretsky writes the highly successful \\u003Cem\\u003EV.I. Warshawski \\u003C/em\\u003Eseries. While both Paretsky and Warshawski share the same heritage and Chicago, (Paretsky graduated from the University of Chicago and her character lives and works there), V.I. also has many of her creator's traits and strengths as a woman and the same tastes in food and liquor. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe masters of fiction have used their own characteristics and personality traits to guide their stories. Stephen King has always infused many of his own fears into the characters populating his excellent literary collection. His fears include spiders, snakes, the elevator in his hotel room and death, all themes in his books. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnne Rice has said that her character Lestat in her famous \\u003Cem\\u003EVampire Chronicles\\u003C/em\\u003E, was largely based on her husband, the poet and artist Stan Rice, sharing his blond hair and birth date of November 7th. Rice also noted that the character Lestat had also taken on some of her own personal attributes.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nErnest Hemingway wrote about his life through the eyes of his alter ego Nick Adams, in 24 pieces of fiction. Basically every story Hemingway wrote came from experience. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nEthnicity and race are also strong components of an author's characters as shown in the award-winning books of Amy Tan, Alice Walker, and Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. Their characters reflect their lives and their own backgrounds.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nSometimes the characters we create are an alter ego that is a part of us that we don't show on a daily basis. Every character I've written has something of me that is evident in them. The sarcasm of Teddy Jameson in \\u003Cem\\u003EWelcome to Hell\\u003C/em\\u003E is a part of me that doesn't appear in \\\"real life\\\" yet it is him speaking through me. The main character in the Cate Harlow Private Investigation series has many of my own attributes, including a lifetime passion for tennis and a need to solve problems. As with all authors, there's a bit of me in all my characters.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFantasy writers put a lot of themselves in their stories, a sort of living life vicariously through characters and situations that they control. Think J.K. Rowling and Ursula Le Guin.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThere's always a piece of an author in each character.

Your prospect has most likely felt sold to so many times that they numb out many marketing messages these days. Truth is, they are looking for that connection, but everyone is just so busy promoting stuff that the personal message gets lost!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnd yet, there's a fine line between sharing too much of your story and focusing on what your prospect needs and wants. This is why it's important to think strategically as a copywriter and incorporate \\\"defining moments\\\" and not just any \\\"story.\\\" Here are some guidelines to help you use your \\\"story\\\" as part of your copy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E1. Use Defining Moments to Solidify Strength\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYears ago, I was trying to figure out the main message of my brand new site Giving Voice to Your Story that you're reading now with a coach. I thought about the connection between life lessons and stories. When we undergo a difficult experience when we're practically pushed out of our comfort zone, we often are able to look back and tell the story. We become stronger over time, but we don't often stop and string our moments of strength together. We are proof that we are stronger than we think we are and we need to proof this point in our copy when we connect with our prospect.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E2. Defining Moments Build Evidence for Your Prospect\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the copywriting world, we call these defining moments evidence. Your story gives your prospect a reason that by understanding the reason, they can then focus on the outcome. For example, if my target niche is writers who are constantly experiencing self-doubt and anxiety about the publishing process, I could share with them a number of stories to show how I was able to move through those blocks by focusing on a defining moment of writing and blogging my memoir. Memoir writing is the most vulnerable kind of writing that encapsulates a string of defining moments that can really create intimacy.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n3. \\u003Cstrong\\u003EExpress Defining Moments in Your Copy\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nMany experienced copywriters will have differing opinions as to where to place the defining moments. Some say at the beginning as a hook while others say once that hook is established.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAnother thing to consider is the use of the personal \\\"I\\\", which should be used just enough to make the point behind your story so your prospect can see him/herself in your story.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nAt the end of the day, you want your defining moment or story to position you as the copywriter. What solution do you have for your prospect? What product or service can help him/her? When you know your prospect thoroughly, then it will be easier to find the right story that will strategically position and brand you.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor us copywriters, our gifts are there for a reason.

We can do what we do and can't do what we can't do. I drew and painted and was deeply into listening to books being read out loud before I discovered I could not spell. School was a struggle. So I clung to what I could do--paint and draw and tell stories--while my friends passed exams. By the time I discovered a word for people like me (dyslexic) I had been making movies and writing books and painting for years. Once I did learn to navigate a world of tests too, at least enough to get a drivers' license, I was hooked on art and culture.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ccenter\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430938088-3182150-ScreenShot20150506at9.47.41PM.png\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-06-1430938088-3182150-ScreenShot20150506at9.47.41PM.png\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-06-1430938088-3182150-ScreenShot20150506at9.47.41PM-thumb.png\\\" width=\\\"296\\\" height=\\\"209\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E \\u003Cem\\u003EFrank \\u0026 his father, Francis Schaeffer\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/center\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003E[CD]: \\u003C/strong\\u003EYou're a progressive thinker and even an activist.

After having photographed Lithuania and Belize from great heights, Jovaiša went in search of the next step. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"I went to see Cuba and realized that nobody has been able to take aerial pictures of that amazing country because of [a] secretive political regime and technical difficulties,” Jovaiša told HuffPost via email. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“I thought it would be awesome to try to become the first man on the planet who could convince the Cuban government to give permission for such an endeavour,” he continued, adding that he always hoped a book like this would attract the attention of many countries. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"cuba aire 02\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2895272/thumbs/o-CUBA-AIRE-02-900.jpg?1\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nJovaiša explained that aerial photography in particular is something that began to interest him 12 years ago.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“It was a combination of my attraction to all types of adrenaline sports (like paragliding, skydiving, bungee jumping, wakeboarding, snowboarding, surfing, etc.) and a passion for photography,” the 41-year-old said. “Being airborne opens up incredible opportunities for exploration and unique imagery. On top of that, I always make sure that all the photos are taken during the most beautiful part of the day: early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun is low, the shadows are long and the colors are stunningly strong and powerful.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"cuba aire 03\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2895274/thumbs/o-CUBA-AIRE-03-900.jpg?1\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut with Cuba, the challenge of taking aerial photographs was even greater. With his own resources, Jovaiša had to buy an aircraft to fly over the island and allow him to capture the landscapes. Anywhere else in the world, renting a helicopter could have been a good option -- but not in the island country, where the only helicopter rental service was located in Havana and offered an oversized, Russian-made MI-8 helicopter that, he says, wasn’t “viable to operate in all country.” \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“After being granted the principal permission to take aerial photos of Cuba, the major issue was what to use for getting airborne,” Jovaiša explained. “In other countries I would always find a little plane or an ultralight to rent but for Cuba I needed to buy my own airplane.”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe photographer ordered an \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/video_fotos/2015/04/150409_fotos_ineditas_aereas_cuba_fp\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Eultralight aircraft\\u003C/a\\u003E from Australia and had it shipped by sea to Cuba. Then, he said, “it took a lot of time and effort to get it certified and prepare a local team of [a] pilot and mechanic to operate it.” \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe results of the time-consuming process and the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/video_fotos/2015/04/150409_fotos_ineditas_aereas_cuba_fp\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E$1 million investment\\u003C/a\\u003E were outstanding. The images Jovaiša was able to capture show a unique perspective of Cuba -- its immense coasts and green valleys as well as its picturesque towns and magnificent buildings, captured in a series of photographs that would leave anyone speechless.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nThe Lithuanian photographer himself was amazed by the aerial view of the Latin American country. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“Amazing views of the Baracoa city and its surroundings are deeply imprinted in my mind,” Jovaiša said. “I like Trinidad and Playa Ancon in the central south part of the country. Valle [de] Viñales is also among my favorites. Another place of incredible beauty is Cayerias del Norte, east of Varadero, where you find Cayo Las Brujas, Cayo Santa Maria and others.\\\"\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"cuba aire 04\\\" src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2895318/thumbs/o-CUBA-AIRE-04-900.jpg?1\\\" /\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFalling in love with Cuba may be easy for those who have visited the island, but Jovaiša wants those who haven’t had the opportunity to set foot in the country to be able to feel the same way through his book. He hopes that people around the world can see the island’s beauty through his photos and realize this location’s great value. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\\"Cuba is a wonder of nature and human history, [an] absolutely unique place in the world,” he said. “It has an amazing variety of landscapes, both natural and man-made. It is also frozen in time as there have not been very many developments since 1959.” \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBut for the photographer, Cuba is more than that. Beyond the fantastic images, the warmth of the island and its people is something Jovaiša familiarized himself with quite well during his years there. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n“The people of Cuba are incredibly sincere, welcoming, warm and tough because of difficult and poor life conditions,” he said. “But instead of breaking them, the difficulties made them very strong and inventive. I have made so many good friends in Cuba during those five years. Our team of pilot Roberto Gonzales and engineer Ariel Ortega has become like a family!”\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nCurrently \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/UnseenCuba\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EUnseen Cuba\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E has only been published in English, but Jovaiša hopes that next year a Spanish-language edition will be produced.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nYou can see the aerial photographs of Cuba taken by Marius Jovaiša below, and visit \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://unseencuba.com/#home\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ethe \\u003Cem\\u003EUnseen Cuba\\u003C/em\\u003E website\\u003C/a\\u003E to learn more about the project and buy a copy of the book. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EThis is a translation of an April 29 HuffPost Voces article that originally appeared \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://voces.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/29/unseen-cuba-marius-jovaisa-fotos_n_7174546.html\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003Ehere\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003CHH--236SLIDEEXPAND--421938--HH\\u003E \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-06T15:41:33-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/06/marius-jovaisa-unseen-cuba_n_7225044.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/06/marius-jovaisa-unseen-cuba_n_7225044.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 06 May 2015 19:41:33 UTC +00:00], ["title", "'Unseen Cuba' Shows Us The Island's Breathtaking Beauty Through Aerial Photographs"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:09:38 UTC +00:00]]

What drew you to writing it?\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI had a long-standing fascination with the Loch Ness monster, starting when I was twelve and first visited Urquhart Castle and was convinced I was going to see it, and a random news article rekindled my interest. The idea of incorporating my favorite castle in the world with the looming prospect of the monster was irresistible, so I booked research trips without having any idea of what my story would be. Ultimately, it came to me in a rush when I was standing at the Water Gate in Urquhart Castle (a location that has great importance in the book), and I spent the rest of the afternoon stomping around the castle dictating ideas into my phone. That day was definitely one of the highlights of my writing life!\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EBoth Jacob in \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://saragruen.com/author/books/water-for-elephants/\\\" target=\\\"_hplink\\\"\\u003EWATER FOR ELEPHANTS\\u003C/a\\u003E and Maddie and Ellis in AT THE WATER'S EDGE suffer a sort of fall from grace at the start of stories, losing access to a once guaranteed future.  What do your stories say about making life your own?  \\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nIn the broadest sense, almost all stories begin with an upheaval of some sort, because normal people doing normal things does not a good story make! I think the stories that appeal to us as readers are those in which people have to examine what's really going on in their lives, or face a huge change in circumstances, and then see what they do going forward. In the case of  AT THE WATER'S EDGE, Maddie and Ellis both face enormous changes in circumstance and their understanding of life as they know it, and react in nearly polar opposite ways to the truths they find. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430796719-8773020-Gruen_authorphoto.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430796719-8773020-Gruen_authorphoto.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430796719-8773020-Gruen_authorphoto-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"405\\\" height=\\\"570\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat roles do travel and research play in your writing?   When does imagination come in?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI love the research part. One of the best things about this job is that I get to find something that fascinates me and that I hope will be fascinating to others, and completely immerse myself in it for a few years. It happens different ways for different books, but in this case the location came first, and after a few weeks of full immersion in the Highlands, the story came to me. It happened while I was standing at the Water Gate, and all the little amorphous bits that were floating around in my brain started to take shape, so I sent my guide back to his car and spent the rest of the afternoon stomping around the castle dictating ideas into my phone. That's one of those writing moments you hope and dream will happen, but very rarely do. I still have the files on my phone. They're taking up a huge amount of space, but I can't bring myself to delete them.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EYour books draw richly on the history of the times; in AT THE WATER'S EDGE, World War II frames the narrative.

How do you balance telling the story and setting the historical scene?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nFor me, I need to take an almost obsessive approach to research. When I'm at the writing stage, I pass through a kind of creative portal every day and feel like I'm really in that other world I've created, and so it has to exist right down to the trowel marks in the plaster, and I'm a stickler for detail. The saying \\\"the devil is in the details\\\" is absolutely right.\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThis is your fifth book; what have you learned about your writing process as you gained more experience?  What stayed the same for you and what has changed?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nI've realized that I can't structure my work time and progress quite as rigidly as I would like to. For my first couple of books, I aimed for (and got, even if it nearly killed me) 2000 words a day. Then I moved to 2000 words a day or eight hours, whichever came first. Now, I feel like if I show up for work and put in an honest day, I've done well. Because I can't force the creative process. Sometimes I am typing as fast as I can all day, and have to drag myself away because there's more to be done, and other times I stare glumly at my open file all day, which is okay, because I've come to realize that when I can't get any words out, it means there's something I need to figure out and change in the storyline and even if my fingers aren't busy, my brain is. \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOut of all the character's you created, who is your favorite and why?\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\nBefore this book, I would have said Rosie, but now I have to say Maddie. She changed so dramatically from what I imagined her to be--coming to life in the way that characters do--and she was so willing to look at things that she had never examined before, in an open-minded and big-hearted way, and she showed courage and resolve in a situation that was utterly impossible, and became increasingly so.  \\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430796880-1319736-book_WFE.jpg\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"2015-05-05-1430796880-1319736-book_WFE.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-05-1430796880-1319736-book_WFE-thumb.jpg\\\" width=\\\"343\\\" height=\\\"555\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cbr /\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EI read that you needed an internet-free zone to write WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.

Then I used Zadie Smith's method--I know the program she's talking about--but I found a workaround, and so that ended up being no help at all. And just in case she ever reads this, I'm not going to say what that workaround is because I do not want to be singlehandedly responsible for the delay of a new Zadie Smith book. \\u003Cp\\u003E-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our \\u003Ca href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'\\u003Eterms.\\u003C/a\\u003E It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-05-06T15:29:07-04:00\",\"guid\":\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brandi-megan-mantha/at-the-waters-edge-a-writ_b_7210030.html\"}"], ["link", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brandi-megan-mantha/at-the-waters-edge-a-writ_b_7210030.html?utm_hp_ref=books&amp;ir=Books"], ["published_at", Wed, 06 May 2015 19:29:07 UTC +00:00], ["title", "At the Water's Edge: A Writer's Conversation With Sara Gruen"], ["updated_at", Thu, 07 May 2015 15:09:38 UTC +00:00]]
