== 99 Cats

This is a website built in Rails modeled after the defunct 99Dresses website. In this version, users can post their cats and rent other peoples cats.

I built this in learning to use Rails. The trickiest part was making it so when the owner of a cat accepts the rental request of an individual it rejects all other requests from the same date.
